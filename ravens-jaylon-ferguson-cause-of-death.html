Defensive lineman Calais Campbell told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">NFL.com</a>, "Jaylon was a great young man to be around. He usually had a big smile on his face and would lighten up the room with a joke. He was just a great, fun guy. He will be missed."</p><p>Fellow linebacker Tyus Bowser added: "His positive energy, encouragement and his belief in me helped mold me into the player and man I am today. He will be missed but never forgotten."</p><p>"We lost a good one," tweeted the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">NFL Players Association</a>.
