The season premiere shines a light on a survival mission in rural San Miguel County’s Sabinoso region, which is located an hour away from Las Vegas.</p><p>According to the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">U.S. Department of the Interior Bureau of Land Management</a>, the Sabinoso wilderness region consists of “a series of high, narrow mesas surrounded by cliff-lined canyons” located in “a remote area in the “northeastern portion of New Mexico.”</p><p>Additionally, the Sabinoso region is said to have a “deep canyon area, surrounded by the wide-open New Mexico plains,” which is unique for the region.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>However, New Mexico is only one piece of the puzzle in terms of filming for Season 15.

Per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Country Reports</a>, Guyana is known for having remote forests, flat swampy terrain, mountainous areas, rolling highlands, and a low coastal plain.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>“Going on Naked and Afraid, it was something I wasn’t going to turn down,” Kami told the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Albuquerque Journal</a>. “It’s a challenge. You have to adapt to your surroundings and you live with someone you just barely met. It pushes you out of your comfort zone.”</p><p>Interestingly, Kami shared that while she’s not game for dealing with Guyana’s climate and pesky mosquitos again, the experience was eye-opening.</p><p>“Would I want to go back to the jungle and get tens of thousands of bug bites,” she asks. “No. But I would go back and experience something like this again. There were highs and lows and a lot I learned about myself.”</p><p>Catch up on episodes of Naked and Afraid on Hulu or Discovery Plus.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfo66sscNmmKecXZazs63InWSsnZGovK95kG5kn6Gcoravs4ylppyZpJ68rw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./287754-vijana-wa-nandi-wajitosa-barabarani-kulalamikia-mashambulizi-dhidi-ya-naibu-rais-william-ruto-html.html><span>←</span><span>Vijana wa Nandi wajitosa barabarani kulalamikia mashambulizi dhidi ya Naibu Rais William Ruto</span></a>
