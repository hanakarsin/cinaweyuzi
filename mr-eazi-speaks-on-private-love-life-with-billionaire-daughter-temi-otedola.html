So is like, I could be married right now and you wouldn’t know and maybe I amn’t just wearing my ring.</p><p>It’s just how you feel like it isn’t everything that should be outside”.</p><h2>They Said I Was Having An Affair With Bobrisky – Yul Edochie</h2><p>Nollywood actor, <a href=#>Yul Edochie</a> has said that some netizens have alleged that he is having an affair with popular crossdresser, Bobrisky.</p><p>Yul explained that after he celebrated Bob on his birthday he suffered harsh criticism from his fans sharing the ordeal via a video uploaded to his YouTube page, Edochie said that some of his admirers flocked to the comment area to accuse him of dating the male barbie.</p><p>He said that some people also called him and insisted that he pulls down the birthday post from his page.</p><p>Edochie insisted that it is unacceptable for people to be condemned because they do not fit into the box society wants them to occupy.</p><p>He said, “Earlier this year, I wished Bobrisky a happy birthday with his picture posted on my Instagram page. And then my page literally blew up and went on fire. By the time I came back, I got thousands of messages on ….. and then my DM was flooded with messages. Somebody actually sent me a DM and said that I’m sleeping with Bobrisky. Just because I wished him a happy birthday on my page.</p><p>“Someone even called me and requested that I pull down …… Some people were even telling me how God destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah. Are you God? Did God send you to destroy Sodom and Gomorrah?”</p><p><i>“</i>Stop&nbsp;judging people, you are not God. Bobrisky is a human being like every other person. Why do we discriminate against people? We should stop all these. God said to love your neighbour as yourself. Nigerians rest.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH5ye49uZqaqXZquu7WMrKeemZuoerC6jKmpoq6RqbJuuM6vnGakmZuybsPIrZ9mmpmhuaq7zZqgq51dma62s8etnKtlpJq6qnnOrZydp5yWfA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./david-strathairn-html.html><span>←</span><span>David Strathairn - Age, Family, Bio</span></a>
