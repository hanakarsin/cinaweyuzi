"Masks should only be used by health workers, caretakers, and by people with those symptoms."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@who href=#>@who</a><p>When & how should masks be worn in order to protect against the new <a title=coronavirus href=#>##coronavirus</a> ?</p><a title="♬ original sound - who" href=#>♬ original sound - who</a></figure><p>But if you find yourself fitting that criteria, they still run down how exactly you should be using the mask to maximize its effectiveness. Their instructions direct you to make sure the mask fits to your face, never touch the outside of the mask, and to never use the same mask twice.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Others are making videos combating the fake health advice on the app.</h2><p>Other health professionals and news outlets have been using the app to refute some of the fake news spreading about how to combat catching the virus. The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) posted a couple of TikToks debunking these false health claims, including the rumor hand dryers kill the virus and antibiotics treat it.&nbsp;</p><p>The only way to kill COVID-19 is to wash your hands — and thoroughly. Just running them through a hand dryer isn't enough to kill the germs. The organization also pointed out that antibiotics do nothing to kill the virus, as it's immune to most drugs.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@thetelegraph href=#>@thetelegraph</a><p>Fake health advice about the coronavirus is plaguing the internet.

The number of people infected by coronavirus has <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">risen to over 90,000 people</a> internationally, and there are now over 100 cases in the United States. If you're only going to get your health information from TikTok, at least make sure it comes from reputable sources on the app.</p><p><strong>The best way to prevent contracting or spreading coronavirus is with </strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>thorough hand washing</strong></a><strong> and </strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>social distancing</strong></a><strong>.
