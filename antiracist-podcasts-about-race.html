The podcast was launched in 2016 and puts out weekly episodes about race culture in America with raw conversations about race among people from different backgrounds.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">'Pod Save the People'</h2><p>Hosted by activists and experts in the field of social injustice, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Pod Save the People</u></a> doubles as an antiracist news source. The weekly podcast delves into racially-charged social issues as well as social justice and culture-themed news.

Host John Biewen discusses with his guests the history of different races in the United States, lynchings of Black people in the early twentieth century, and what it means to be a White person versus a Black person in America.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Please give this podcast a listen.

And if you happen to be a white person, you probably won't ever understand the plight. Being willing to try to understand, however, is where it starts, and antiracist podcasts from Black women offer another perspective of racism against Black people in America.</p><p>Like <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Intersectionality Matters!</u></a>, hosted by Kimberlé Williams Crenshaw, a civil rights advocate and attorney.
