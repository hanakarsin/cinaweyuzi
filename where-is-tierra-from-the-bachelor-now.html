While she may be a perfectly decent human being in real life, the series framed her to be seriously conniving. Between snide remarks and legendary tearful interviews, she was certainly a force to be reckoned with.</p><p>However, fans of the iconic antagonist can't help but wonder <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">what happened to Tierra after Season 17 of The Bachelor</a> ended. We're happy to say it seems as though the Bach Nation villain may have moved on to bigger and better things.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: ABC</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">It seems like Tierra may be taken.</h2><p>Whether you were rooting for Tierra on The Bachelor, or if you just couldn't wait to get rid of her, chances are you wish her the best, and luckily it seems like her love life is thriving at the moment. Although Tierra's social media accounts are private, according to Heavy, her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Facebook</a> account shows that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she's dating a man named Tyler Brooks Brown</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>According to Us Weekly, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tyler and Tierra met in December 2019</a> on New Years Eve, and per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">his Facebook profile</a>, he initially hails from Wiley, Colo., but later in life, moved to Denver. Bustle claims that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tierra is still living in Las Vegas</a>, though, so it sounds like they're doing things long-distance. Either way, he doesn't appear to have 30 other girlfriends like Sean did, so we're hoping for the best.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: ABC</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Tierra was engaged shortly after her time on the show, but that ended within the year.</h2><p>When Tierra returned for Sean Lowe's iteration of "Women Tell All," she presented her fellow suitresses with an engagement ring from an old fling. According to Refinery29, when Sean "broke up" with Tierra, she returned home, to find that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">her ex of several years had texted her incessantly</a>, in a fiery attempt to get her back.&nbsp;</p><p>Although her mystery man had popped the question, their engagement was short-lived. It only lasted until September of that same year until she announced they broken things off. Hopefully for Tierra's sake, Tyler will truly be "the one." That being said, Tierra's relationship track record has been tumultuous, to say the least.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: YouTube</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Tierra is laying low these days.</h2><p>While most Bachelor contestants try to milk their reality show fame as much as possible, Tierra grew tired of it relatively quickly. She essentially stepped out of the spotlight for a few years, before hopping on <a href=# rel=noreferrer>a podcast called Mouthing Off </a>which is hosted by another Bach Nation contestant, Olivia Caridi.</p><p>There, she addressed why she no longer wanted to be in the limelight. "I just felt like, why do I need to keep telling my story?" she said, explaining why her social media profiles are private. These days, she's working as a leasing consultant in her hometown, and it sounds like she's — well — doing much better than she was on the show.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram</a></figure><p>Unlike other <a href=#>Bach Nation villains</a> (ahem, Krystal or Corinne!) Tierra seems to want nothing to do with fame or attention. She appears to be loving her quiet life, and that's great.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWmvsRmoKxlpJ6ys77AZp2rp51iwamxjJuYnKCVobyzec2org%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./eva-gutowski-html.html><span>←</span><span>Eva Gutowski - Age, Family, Bio</span></a>
