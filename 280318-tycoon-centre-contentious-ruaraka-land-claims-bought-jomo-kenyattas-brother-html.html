We will lose our country by taking powers of president. A developing country like Kenya needs needs dictatorship for development. It is sad currently everybody is powerful and has no respect for the law hence this impunity," he said.<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/720/0fgjhs7k2iduua56t.jpeg><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>Detectives raid home of man who sold government its own land in Ruaraka at KSh 3.2 billion</p><p class=align-left>He said, lack of a central point of authority would make every greedy leader think they can rule and trample over people as they wished.</p><p class=align-left>Mburu who claims to be a humble and self-made billionaire alleged Sonko was not straightforward and was lying to the residents by claiming he had surrendered 13 acres to the government.</p>"I have owned this land which is a freehold property from 1981 after purchasing it from Peter Kenyatta, Arthur Magugu, Duncan Ndegwa late Njenga Karume when I was 30 years old.

There is no scam as the scandal is with the governor. He lied to the people and now he is now excusing city council and I have sued them for KSh 30 billion," Mburu explained.<p class=align-left>The tycoon who acknowledged he owns numerous companies in Kenya and abroad denied the KSh 1.5 billion he received from government was distributed to different suspicious accounts, saying the mentioned accounts belonged to his enterprises.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>War on corruption is not targeting communities but individuals - Raila Odinga</p>"Parliament and the Finance Ministry approved the payment after assessing all the documents.
