"Much love to those who do but my baldness is by choice."</p><p>She added in a video, "I shaved my head bald.

The 43-year-old hopes her work with patients suffering from mental issues, homelessness, schizophrenia, and chronic depression will redefine the roles Black women are often forced into.</p><p>"[It was] very important for me to make sure that my personality was portrayed on Married to Medicine in a multifaceted fashion instead of a one-dimensional one," she said in an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Essence</a>. "Overwhelmingly, I believe that most Black women on reality TV shows fit the same tropes that we‚Äôve always seen in entertainment."</p><p>The Xavier alum added, "There are Black psychiatrists. We‚Äôre not everywhere but we are out there. Even if they don‚Äôt end up seeing a Black psychiatrist, I just want Black women to know that there are empathetic doctors who really do like our jobs and want to help people with mental illness get better."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Dr. Imani is a happily married mother-of-one.</h2><p>According to her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bravo bio</a>, the 6'2" beauty loves nothing more than a "quiet night at home with her husband, Phil Johnson, from the 90‚Äôs R&B group Portrait, and [12-year-old] son, Idris."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>In November, Imani celebrated the couple‚Äôs anniversary with a sweet <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram post</a>. "Ten years to the day we met and five years married. Thank you for always having my back and offering me the type of advice only someone you call your best friend can provide," she wrote. "Happy anniversary to us!!!"</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Dr. Imani feels a special connection to her patients due to her own complicated childhood.</h2><p>The reality star revealed that her father and uncle struggled with substance abuse when she was growing up. "Most [addicts] are mentally ill and they‚Äôre self-medicating," she shared. "A lot of times that person has a very interesting story."&nbsp;</p><p>As for how Imani maintains her own mental health while working such a tough job, the healthcare professional explained, "Patients themselves don‚Äôt take a toll on me‚Ä¶ If anything it‚Äôs an enjoyable challenge. The real toll is the administrative stuff."</p><p>Imani told Essence that her "self-care strategies include delegating tasks, meditating, exercising, and occasionally going to the spa."
