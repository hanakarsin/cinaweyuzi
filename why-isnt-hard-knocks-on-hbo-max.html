The season focused on the Chicago Bears training camp and preseason. The episodes typically air live on HBO at 8 p.m. CT on Tuesdays, followed by streaming on Max the following day.</p><p>However, when the episode ended on HBO, it wasn't available to stream on HBO Max, sparking concern from fans. One of them was Chicago Bears and ESPN reporter <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Courtney Cronin</a>.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Anyone else with HBO Max unable to stream Hard Knocks?</p>— Courtney Cronin (@CourtneyRCronin) <a href=#>August 14, 2024</a></figure><p>Courtney was one of the first Hard Knocks watchers to post about the missing episode on X (formerly Twitter). She asked her followers if she was the only one with an HBO Max account who didn't see the episode available on their end. Courtney received over 200 replies from other fans who had experienced the same thing, with some jokingly blaming the Bears, stating the team <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"crashed HBO."</a></p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>There is a delay for tonight's episode of <a href=#>#HardKnocks</a>: Training Camp with the <a href=#>@ChicagoBears</a> on Max.

"The episode will be available soon."</p><p>An hour after Sports on Max's post, the account followed up with another tweet confirming the episode was available to stream on HBO Max. Unfortunately, for many, the damage was already done, as multiple current account holders threatened to cancel their subscriptions and demanded refunds.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLW6ecispa1lmJa%2FpXnKp6aco6NivK95x5umZqWRrQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./terry-crews-magazine-cover.html><span>←</span><span>Photos Of Actor Terry Crews Illustrating Magazine Cover Take Internet By Storm</span></a>
