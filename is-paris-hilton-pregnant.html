At 40 years old, she seems busier than ever. In addition to planning her wedding to <a href=#>fiancé Carter Reum</a>, she has a <a href=#>new cooking show</a> coming out on Netflix and also hosts a weekly podcast.</p><p>As it turns out, that’s not all that Paris has on her plate these days. She has also been talking more and more about starting her own family in the near future. Naturally, people are wondering: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Is Paris Hilton pregnant?</a> Here's what we know.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">'Page Six' reported that Paris Hilton was pregnant, but Paris set the record straight.</h2><p>In July of 2021, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Page Six</a> reported that Paris and fiancé <a href=#>Carter Reum</a> were expecting their first child together. However, Paris shut the rumors down in an episode of her podcast and clarified that she is not pregnant. "I am not pregnant, not yet," she said. "I am waiting until after the wedding. My dress is being made right now so I want to make sure it looks gorgeous and fits perfectly, so definitely waiting for that part."</p><p>Back in January, Paris revealed that she had begun undergoing IVF treatments in order to make her dream of becoming a mother a reality. In an August 2020 interview with Britain’s <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Sunday Times</u></a>, Paris said that she was inspired by <a href=#>Kim Kardashian</a> to freeze her eggs as part of her own personal fertility plan. “I think every woman should do it because you can really control it and not have that ‘Oh my God, I need to get married’ [mindset],” she said.&nbsp;</p><p>Paris also said at the time that she was interested in having not just one baby, but two at the same time! "I’m obsessed with dressing them up. I want […] twins, because then you get [a girl and a boy] at once,” she said." Even if she doesn't have twins, though, Paris is clearly very excited about the prospect of becoming a mother after her and Carter's wedding.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>My brother just sent me this and my heart is melting. 😍😭 So in love with my beautiful baby niece Milou. 🥰 My new nickname for her is #BunnyLove 🐇🐇👶🏼🐇🐇 #AuntieParis ☺️</a></p><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap">A post shared by <a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px>Paris Hilton</a> (@parishilton) on Jul 24, 2020 at 9:50am PDT</p></figure><p>Judging from her Instagram feed, she already gets a lot of facetime with little kids — she’s an aunt to three little girls! Her little sister Nicky has two daughters, Lily and Teddy, and her brother Barron has a baby daughter named Milou. If Paris is feeling a touch of the baby fever with all of those adorable kiddos in the family, we certainly can’t blame her.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">When are Paris Hilton and Carter Reum getting married?</h2><p>As Paris already pointed out, she doesn’t necessarily feel the need to get married before she has kids, but it looks like that may be the plan at the moment. She and Carter got engaged on Feb. 13, 2021, and have started planning their wedding in the meantime. The entire wedding planning process is being documented for the upcoming 13-part docuseries Paris in Love, which will be streaming on Peacock.</p><p>"I really want my fans and everyone to see that I did finally get my happy, fairytale ending and just showing the next part of my life," Paris told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a> about the series. "So, I just feel now I'm an open book, I've put it all out there. I have nothing to hide and I'm just so proud of how everything is today and I just feel like my fans will really enjoy just seeing this like, maybe one of the most special moments of my life."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>Happy Anniversary my love.
