For example, we are talking about an administration of the last seven years. They dealt with two economic recessions — one of which was global — and a once-in-a-century global pandemic, where we saw oil prices hit as low as 10 dollar per barrel, where countries were shut down.</p><p>“We understand that there are these peculiarities that any honest assessment must factor in when we make this assessment.</p><p>“With a consistently low oil price from 2016 to 2022, we have been able to construct a high-speed rail line of 326km that had been abandoned since 1987.”</p><h2>He Has Done Well</h2><p>Giving an overall assessment of Buhari’s performance, Ngelale said there’s no doubt the President has performed well.</p><p>“If you are asking me a straightforward question of whether I believe that President Muhammadu Buhari administration has performed well, given all of the factors that I have mentioned and those that I have not mentioned yet, I will tell you with an emphatic ‘yes’, that he has done well,” he stated.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH5ye49tZpynpp6xbn2YZpycp56kuqqvjKucnJ2jqLawuoyanZ%2Bdk6mypXnBrp%2BaqpmoerGx0Z%2Bmq6WRo7CmecCim55n</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./senate-to-probe-buhari-emefiele-over-n30trn-ways-and-means.html><span>←</span><span>Senate To Probe Buhari, Emefiele Over N30trn Ways And Means</span></a>
