The casting decision shows a massive lack of respect for Deaf professionals, and the letter states there was "no acknowledgement given to the psyche of a Deaf character," as being deaf is "more than just not hearing."</p><p>"This is not the '90s," Jade said in a separate statement to People. "Deaf artists are thriving. There are a large pool of Deaf actors who are qualified enough to play the character Nick Andros."</p><p>Jade wrote that the network failed these talented actors "because there was no casting notice which afforded them the opportunity to audition and showcase their talent for the role."</p><p>Likewise, model, actor, executive producer, and deaf activist Nyle DiMarco voiced his displeasure at the casting decision. The America's Next Top Model winner was one of the first members of the deaf community to speak out about The Stand's casting over a year ago, back in August of 2019.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Nick Andros is DEAF in <a href=#>#TheStand</a> and is being played by a hearing actor <a href=#>@henryzaga</a>.</p><p>Hollywood takes pride in diversity to ensure representation & authenticity.., BUT CONTINUES TO EXCLUDE people with disabilities.<a href=#>@StephenKing</a> <a href=#>@CBSNews</a> <a href=#>https://t.co/r1vS5GOOGs</a></p>— Nyle DiMarco (@NyleDiMarco) <a href=#>August 2, 2019</a></figure><p>"Two months ago @CBSTVStudios pledged to make casting more inclusive," he tweeted at the time.
