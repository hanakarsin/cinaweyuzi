He said because the first time he contested, he picked (Chuba) Okadigbo; flamboyant, catholic, but Nigerians didn’t vote for him (Buhari). The second time, he picked another Igbo, Edwin Ume-Ezeoke, Nigerians didn’t vote for him, that if he brought the Pope to run as his deputy, Nigerians would not vote for him, that&nbsp; ‘you, Bola Tinubu, you have six governors, you have never lost an election before, come and be my running mate.</p><p>“He knew all the calculations then favoured us. That was why he wanted me as his running mate, but I told him to let us build the party first. And when we finished building the party, we brought in people from the PDP.&nbsp; Saraki saw that those from the PDP would not get anything if Buhari, a Muslim becomes the President and me, also a Muslim becomes his deputy. He won’t become the Senate President and the Senate President could not also be a Muslim. That was how they started the campaign of calumny against me.</p><p>“And I told them that I had a candidate that is a Christan that I could nominate so that the party would not break. That was how I nominated Vice President Yemi Osinbajo. I surrendered my right to him (Osinbajo).”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH13e49sZqGnp2LAor7ApKBmq6SkvbGxw2aZrqCRp7ZustGopGaomZi4qrrGZqSeZZGoere8jJucnJmlqLJutMRmrpqmpJqxbsDOZpmeZaOau6LAxGanq52jnrGmutNmmaikkWLBqrrUm6xo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./103685-cord-principal-moses-wetangula-ridiculed-getting-beating-wife-html.html><span>←</span><span>Cord principal Moses Wetangula ridiculed after getting a beating from wife</span></a>
