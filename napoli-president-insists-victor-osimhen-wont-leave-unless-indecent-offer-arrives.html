But Napoli have not changed their decision to keep their best striker.</p><p>Reports claimed that PSG have gone as far as making a €100 million bid for Osimhen but Napoli turned it down as they continue to negotiate a new deal with the prolific striker.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Recent reports claimed that PSG would prioritize signing Osimhen if Kylian Mbappe leaves the French club this summer as the Frenchman’s contract is set to expire next summer.</a></p><p>Also, Napoli and Osimhen’s representatives have not been able to reach a new deal for the striker <a href=# rel=noopener>because the Italian champions have not agreed to Osimhen’s new wage demand.</a> His contract with the club will expire on June 30, 2025.</p><p>Amidst that, de Laurentiis told the press on Monday that: “We will see Victor Osimhen wearing our shirt next season, that’s for sure”.</p><p>He then added, “Then if a ‘more than indecent proposal arrives, we will move on and find another top talent as we did with Kvaratskhelia and Osimhen”.</p><p>The “indecent proposal” the Napoli president is referring to could be the €180 million price tag the club slammed on Osimhen which most clubs are unwilling to pay. Hence, if any club dare to pay such an amount for the Nigeria international, Osimhen would leave Napoli this summer.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpjZH14e5BpZqeZoKS5qnnPq5ysoZSau7V5yKeqoqukqHq3tcKtpqtln6i2rrTEp2Swp56peq2xwK%2BcZq2eobK0v4yipZ2dk5q7tXnOn52eql2Wv7O11Z6qaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./2001-html.html><span>←</span><span>Died in 2001 | Famous Birthdays</span></a>
