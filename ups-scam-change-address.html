And all it took for him was to hoist a bucket out of the back of an armored truck when no one was looking. Seems like an obvious tactic most people wouldn't attempt, on account of the guards being armed and all - the whole thing just seems too simple to work, but it did.&nbsp;</p><p>It's that same criminal simplicity that temporarily worked for this Chicago man who was seemingly able to, on paper, make his home address Atlanta's UPS Headquarters. Which not only netted him a lot of mail, but some cash to boot.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: getty</span></figure><p>Dushaun Henderson-Spruce allegedly didn't need to do much to convince everyone that the Atlanta, Georgia UPS headquarters business address was his home - all he needed to do was grab a USPS change of address form and fill it out.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>This is quite the mail fraud scheme:<br>-guy changes his address to the corporate address of UPS<br>-he signs form w/ his initials, scratches that out and just signs "UPS"<br>-so much mail arrives USPS has to put a tub outside his door<br>-this lasts nearly 3 months<a href=#>https://t.co/RBHvCesP8S</a></p>‚Äî Nathan Patin (@NathanPatin) <a href=#>May 10, 2018</a></figure><p>The Chicago Tribune reported that Spruce even messed up while filling out the form: "Henderson-Spruce did not identify himself on the one-page form.

He was receiving tons and tons of mail every single day.</p><p>Sometimes it was handed directly to him, other days it was placed in a ginormous UPS tub right outside of his door because all of the correspondence wouldn't fit in his mailbox. And it wasn't just bills and coupons Henderson-Spruce was receiving: it was paychecks and credit cards.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: istock</span></figure><p>Roughly 10 checks made out to UPS worth a collective $58,000 were deposited into Henderson's bank account, and the affidavit doesn't indicate whether or not he used the corporate American Express credit cards that were sent to his home.</p><p>Henderson had accumulated some 3,000+ pieces of mail intended for the UPS corporate office in Atlanta, which also included personal employee data, before UPS' security team started to get suspicious. Postal Inspectors eventually paid Henderson a visit at his apartment, where they managed to have a little chat.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>"The post office duly updated the address, and Henderson-Spruce allegedly began receiving the company's mail ‚Äî including checks.

When The Tribune interviewed Henderson-Spruce, he intimated that all of the mail was forwarded to his house as a result of some kind of mix-up, but he didn't explain the situation any further.</p><p>He was charged with misdemeanor bank fraud and the possession of a stolen check. But now he is facing a federal offenses for mail theft and fraud, which carry maximum sentences of 5 and 20 years respectively.</p><p>Henderson's story is prompting a lot of people to ask a very obvious question: how the heck was it so easy for someone to do this, and what's stopping others from doing exactly the same thing?</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>‚Äúthe Postal Inspection Service had received 17,077 complaints ‚Äùrelating to fraudulent address changes‚Äú in the past year‚Äù</p><p>They might want to look into that. <a href=#>https://t.co/vxreEPBvEp</a></p>‚Äî Santos L.

To put it in perspective, 37 million change of address requests were processed last year and 99.9 percent of them were deemed to be totally kosher.</p>"The rate of suspicious transactions reported by customers is less than 1/10 of 1 percent and many of the complaints are determined not to be related to fraud. A number of these complaints can be traced to domestic or other disputes between families and friends, who have access as a result of their relationship to information which allows one to forward mail. Still others can be attributed to service-related issues."We are continuously implementing security enhancements to enhance the security of our change of address process. We continue to assess these options, as we determine the best alternatives to protect the needs of our customers." - USPS in a statement to NPR.<figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I'm still trying to figure out if this was stupid or brilliant, and wondering how often it's happened.<br><a href=#>https://t.co/ilqmYiqIw8</a></p>‚Äî Steve Wheeler (@Steve_JRA) <a href=#>May 10, 2018</a></figure><p>The simplicity of Henderson's plan, despite what USPS says, has got some people admiring his bold criminal approach.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I can't tell if this is a good plan poorly executed or terrible plan carried out beautifully.</p>‚Äî Nate (@Friendjutant) <a href=#>May 10, 2018</a></figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>A+ for gumption<br>C- for inventing a scheme that had any chance of not resulting in jail time <a href=#>https://t.co/Bey0Zngdci</a></p>‚Äî Leon Wolf (@LeonHWolf) <a href=#>May 10, 2018</a></figure><p>And it's got some thinking that, hey, if it's that easy, they should commit some change of address fraud of their own for a little while.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I wonder if I could get the accounts receivable address for some bank, or the shipping department for a big toy store, changed to my home.
