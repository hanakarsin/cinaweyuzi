In the first Europa Conference League, he finished as the highest goalscorer in the tournament with 10 goals while on loan at Feyenoord.</p><p>Dessers, who scored seven Serie A goals in 29 appearances for relegated Cremonese will attempt to replicate his goal-scoring prowess in Glasgow. Also, his great reputation in the Netherlands suggests that he has the potential to flourish in the Scottish Premiership despite his underwhelming Serie A campaign.</p><p>When Daily Record asked Gernot Rohr about Cyriel Dessers, the German tactician described the Nigeria international as an “all-round striker and a player who is perfect for the modern game”.</p><p>Dessers, in Rohr’s perspective, would have been called up to more international teams had it not been for a period of inactivity at the club.</p><p>The coach added, “He is very mobile, possesses great speed, and is strong and powerful in the air. Not only is he comfortable on the ball, but he can also score goals with both feet. Furthermore, he demonstrates great discipline on and off the pitch.”</p><p>So far in his international career, Dessers has made four appearances, with his most recent appearance being in a September 2022 friendly match against Algeria.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpjZH14e49yZqCdoqO8tXnRqJ%2BrZZKauaqx1Z6qZpupp7amuIydnKyrlafAbsPIpaNmnpykwrO10qFkoqZdnLmiv8aormaqkaO0pr7SaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./alejandra-barros-html.html><span>←</span><span>Alejandra Barros - Age, Family, Bio</span></a>
