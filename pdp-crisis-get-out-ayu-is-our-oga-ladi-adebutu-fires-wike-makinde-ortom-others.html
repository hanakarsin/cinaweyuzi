Ayu Is Our Oga'</h1></header><section class=post-content><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.naijanews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Ladi-Adebutu-and-Nyesom-Wike.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><h2>The Governorship candidate of the <a href=# rel=noopener>Peoples Democratic Party (PDP)</a> for Ogun State, Ladi Adebutu, has called on the five aggrieved governors of the party who are against the national chairman of the PDP, Dr. Iyorchia Ayu, to resign from the party.</h2><p><strong>Naija News</strong> reports that Governors <strong>Nyesom Wike</strong>, <strong>Seyi Makinde</strong>, <strong>Samuel Ortom</strong>, <strong>Okezie Ikpeazu</strong>, and <strong>Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi</strong> of Rivers, Oyo, Benue, Abia, and Enugu States respectively had pulled out of the PDP presidential campaign.</p><p>The aggrieved governors had insisted on the removal or resignation of the party’s national chairman, <strong>Dr. Iyorchia Ayu</strong>, before campaigning for Atiku.</p><p>According to them, Ayu had promised that he would resign his position if a northerner emerged as the presidential candidate of the PDP.</p><p>The main opposition party has been unable to resolve the crisis with both camps engaging in a media war.</p><h2>‘Accept Or Leave’</h2><p>Speaking to non-indigene residents in Ogun at a gathering in Abeokuta, Adebutu said those unwilling to abide by the decision of a party are free to leave or form their own party.</p><p>Making a veiled reference to the governors, Wike, Makinde, and Ortom, Adebutu said: “Unlike those that don’t understand that the party is supreme, that Iyorchia Ayu is our ‘oga,’ they don’t recognize that he has the power to hire and fire, we accept his leadership.</p><p>“By the Supreme Court judgments severally pronounced, those that don’t like your party has a few choices, they can either abide, go and form their own party or get out! We have chosen to abide by and obey Ayu’s dictates.</p><p>“We agree he is our chairman. We agree that Hon. Sikirulahi Ogundele is our leader in Ogun and he is representing Iyorchia Ayu. We agree to submit ourselves to the National Working Committee of the party. Those that don’t abide should go and form their own party.”</p><h2>Ogun PDP Crisis</h2><p>On the crisis rocking the PDP in Ogun, the former lawmaker accused the opposition of trying to destabilize the party.</p><p>“I want to reassure you that all the shenanigans of these naysayers, of these terrible human beings, have failed in their mission to disrupt our party. Let us stay united, don’t be distracted. They have a purpose to distract us. They have worked for their pay, they have worked for their purpose, they have done their job.</p><p>“Let us be focused, in the next few weeks we will be free; and when we are free, we will continue our journey,” he said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH5ye49uZqmcoGKws7XSoqpmn5WperDB02aYsq1dnsBuu9SrZKifkWK5orDIZpidnZKqwbZ5xaKpnqtdrLassYymmKShnpmybrvRraamZZ%2Bptaa%2B0mg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./megan-fox-machine-gun-kelly-relationship-timeline.html><span>←</span><span>Machine Gun Kelly and Megan Fox's Romantic Roller Coaster Are They Together?</span></a>
