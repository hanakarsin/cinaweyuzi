And while many of us require a coffee or two to keep going on a Monday, those days could soon be over. Uplift Desk have created the Under Desk Hammock, a hammock that fits under their standing desks, and which allows workers to take a midday nap.&nbsp;</p><p>The hammock, which comes in blue and grey, is easy to install. All you need to do is clip the hammock onto the brand's frame using the included carabiners and then install two anchor plates on the frame using the provided mounting points.&nbsp;</p><p>Yes, this could be you.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Uplift Desk</span></figure><p>The hammocks are available for purchase on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Uplift Desk's</a> website for $55. The website also goes on to explain the hammock's features:</p><li>"Transform your UPLIFT V2 Standing Desk into a place where you can relax and recharge (or take a midday nap) with the Under Desk Hammock</li><li>Impress your coworkers and friends with this unique conversation piece, available in either gray or blue</li><li>Quickly clip the hammock onto the sturdy UPLIFT V2 Frame using the included carabiners—and remove it just as quickly</li><li>No need to drill any holes; just install two anchor plates on the frame using our patent-pending mounting points</li><li>Use the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Connect mobile app</a> to change the height of your hammock, making it easy to get in or out when you're ready to lie down or stand back up</li><li>The hammock comes with its own storage bag, which stays attached so it won't get lost. While you're kicking back under your desk, the bag doubles as a handy place to keep your phone, glasses, or bottled drink."</li><p>And if you're having a difficult time convincing your boss to pick up a few hammocks, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">there are a few studies</a> you can show them to help your point.</p><p>In a study published in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Nature Neuroscience</a>, researchers found that the participants’ performances on tests deteriorated throughout the day. A 30-minute nap between the tests stopped the decrease, and those who took a 60-minute nap actually improved.&nbsp;</p><p>Studies at <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Harvard Medical School</a> and the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">University of California</a> found that napping boosts right-brain activity, making you more creative. And if you managed to catch some deep REM sleep during your nap, the boost to creativity is even stronger.&nbsp;</p><p>The best time to take a nap at work? According to the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mayo Clinic</a> this is usually after you’ve had lunch, around 2 or 3pm. A good nap should last around 10 to 30 minutes, with anything longer leaving you feeling groggy.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqrulsdFmm56rm2K1ornMqJqk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./falana-to-malami-provide-information-on-trial-of-800-boko-haram-suspects.html><span>←</span><span>Provide Information On Trial Of 800 Boko Haram Suspects</span></a>
