From the moment the actor and the singer linked up, they became Hollywood's "It" couple with fans fawning over their PDA (or cringing at it).</p><p>But nothing gold can stay, or so the saying goes. Megan and MGK's relationship reportedly ended in March 2023 after an engagement full of ups and downs. But, after attending an event together in London on May 30, the two seem to be working toward reconciliation. Here's what we know about their current status as a pair and a look at their relationship timeline.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Megan Fox and Machine Gun Kelly started off as friends.</h2><p>On March 11, 2020, MGK shared an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">image</a> from the set of Midnight in the Switchgrass. In it, fans could see his chair positioned directly next to Megan's. They were working jointly on the film in Puerto Rico.</p><p>Things went quiet for a few months. However, in May 2020, the two were spotted together at Megan's house amid the early days of her rift-turned-split from now-ex-husband Brian Austin Green, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a>.</p><p>On May 20, 2020, MGK revealed the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">music video</a> for his song "Bloody Valentine," starring Megan. By June 16, 2020, the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Daily Mail</a> confirmed that the two were an item after they were seen holding hands and kissing in public. On July 22, 2020, the new couple further confirmed their romance and its origins to Lala Kent on her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">podcast</a>. On July 28, 2020, MGK made them <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram official</a>. A week later, Megan did the same.</p><p>While on <a href=# style=text-align:start rel="noopener noreferrer">The Howard Stern Show</a>, MGK shared that he "didn't know what [love] was until me and [Megan] made eye contact."</p><p>At the 2020 American Music Awards, MGK and Megan made their red-carpet debut as a couple. Things continued to heat up between the two both publicly and privately, culminating in engagement rumors at the beginning of 2021.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Nothing was confirmed at the time, but the pair went on being as loved-up as ever.

Shortly after, the singer also revealed on <a href=# style=text-align:start rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a> that the two were raising a kitten together.

Things picked back up after that, with the two sharing <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">images</a> of them attending Beyonc√©'s 41st birthday party together.

On June 4, Megan posted a teasing photo of her wearing nothing but a black bikini along with the caption, "ace of cups + the star."
