And of course, she can’t do that without completely cutting off all ties to her former life with Sandy — which includes the future of their shared home.</p><p>However, word on the street is that Ariana may not have actually moved out of their residence. Here’s the full scoop.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Do Ariana Madix and Tom Sandoval still live together?</h2><p>Ariana reveals in a sneak peek of Season 11 of Vanderpump Rules on Peacock that she and Tom still live together. But it's not what you think. Despite the fact that they are (in Taylor Swift's words) never ever getting back together, Tom and Ariana have yet to sell their shared house. And neither have left yet.</p><p>When Katie asks Ariana what the deal is, Ariana says that she would like to sell the house, get her money back from purchasing it, and move on. Tom, on the other hand, doesn't want to leave the home. And, as to be expected, Ariana isn't just going to give up the house that is legally half hers.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram / @arianamadix</a></figure><p>While Ariana and Tom deal with the details of their shared home, they still have no contact with each other. According to Ariana, they communicate through their assistants. Which is probably best for everyone, to be honest.</p><p>Interestingly, fans initially believed that Ariana moved out of her shared home with Sandy due to a May 2023 Instagram story post.</p><p>In the video, Ariana was seen outside of the home with packed cardboard boxes with text that read, “Ready to dip out.”</p><p>Unfortunately, the video of Ariana moving out of the home was staged for a brand partnership. SoFi, a financial services company, confirmed to People that the video was a “stunt.”</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Ariana Madix Teases Moving Out of House With Sandoval: 'Ready to Dip Out' Closing the book.

I will have more to share with you very, very soon.”</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">So, when will Ariana Madix move out of the Los Angeles home?</h2><p>Even though Ariana still resides in the Los Angeles home, the Dancing With the Stars alum has been open about her desire to sell the home immediately.</p><p>On May 18, 2023, Ariana appeared on Bravo’s Watch What Happens Live hosted by <a href=#>Andy Cohen</a>, where she shared her plans for moving forward.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><p>“My plan is to sell the house,” Ariana said to Andy. “I want my money out of that house as quickly as possible, and I want to move on.”</p><p>Ariana also revealed that she and Sandy “do not interact on any level.” She also confirmed to Andy that they both still live in the house.</p><p>Truth be told, selling a home is not a quick process. Between finding serious buyers, going through the necessary paperwork, and having to split the sale with Sandy, Ariana may be in for a long ride.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Clever</a> shared that it takes approximately two and a half months to sell a home in California. However, the timeline can vary based on the current housing market, buyer demand, time of year, and more.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>But the idea of seeing how Ariana and Tom live together during Season 11 of Vanderpump Rules is enough to excite fans for the season even more, post-Scandoval.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmbxurdGimKeZXaKupbXXZpinnF2pvK550pqlnaemlrluv9Oio6VlnJ7DpnnTqJ6erJiavw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./be-ready-to-lose-your-seat-pdp-threatens-matawalle-over-defection-to-apc.html><span>←</span><span>Be Ready To Lose Your Seat</span></a>
