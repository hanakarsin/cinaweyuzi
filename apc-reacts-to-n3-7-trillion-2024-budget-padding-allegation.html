But we know once a budget is passed, there are ways by which it will be harmonised.</p><p>“One will find it strange, to say the least, that such an addition outside of what has been agreed intra-chambers in a bid to have a harmonised budget, can be unilaterally inflated by one person or chamber. It will be one of the eight wonders of the world for them to consider that.</p><p>“But assuming without conceding that it was unimaginably possible, that calls for the highest level of investigation. However, I think it is too difficult to believe such a thing can happen in a chamber that is regulated and follows due process in passing the budget.’’</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpkZH10e5BrZpqok2K%2Fpq3CrapmrJ9iu3R5lmarq6GcobawuoxrZ2tsXZfCpbPErWSpmZSZtq%2BzjJqjpZ2XlsGqu81o</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./best-sword-in-elden-ring.html><span>←</span><span>What's the Best Sword in 'Elden Ring' and Where Can You Find It?
