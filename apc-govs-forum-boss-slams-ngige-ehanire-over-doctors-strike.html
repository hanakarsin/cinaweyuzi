Lukman, who blamed the ministers for the industrial action by the doctors, which has crippled health facilities nationwide, condemned their alleged failure to pre-empt the strike action and move to nip it in the bud."><meta name=author content="Lourie Helzer"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

This is not simply about negotiating terms and conditions of services of health workers in the country. It is more about creatively ensuring that these are sectors that are essential services sectors with commensurate benefits that is beyond monetary provisions.</p><p>“Over the years however, conciliation and mediation, as functions of labour administration, have greatly declined due to lethargic factors largely because of indecisiveness of Ministry of Labour.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH15e49xZpqok2K0sMLSZp2oqqWieqO70qxkrKSRosBuusainp5llZ2ur7XRnmSorpWneqW7wq2mq6tdqMGztcqeZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./oscar-de-la-hoya-drug-overdose.html><span>←</span><span>Oscar De La Hoya Reveals Painful Past Ahead of Now Canceled Fight</span></a>
