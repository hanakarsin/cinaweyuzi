Such comments have no place in a Department of Justice report."</p><p>Certainly not helping Biden's case has been the reoccurrence of blunders he's made in his speeches, including in February 2024 when he mistook Germany's Angela Merkel for the late former chancellor Helmut Kohl in his recollection of a 2021 conversation about the Jan. 6 Capitol attacks:</p><p>"When I first got elected president, I went to a G7 meeting with the seven heads of state in Europe and Great Britain," Biden said, later adding that "Helmut Kohl of Germany looked at me and said, 'What would you say, Mr. President, if you picked up the London Times tomorrow morning and learned that 1,000 people had broken down the doors, the doors of the British Parliament and killed some [people] on the way in?'"</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>.<a href=#>@DM_Maureen_</a> 'She knows what will become of her next.' <a href=#>https://t.co/RHdJ1QDfl6</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/6XhPSTFeBK</a></p>‚Äî Daily Mail US (@DailyMail) <a href=#>July 2, 2024</a></figure><p>After the gaffe, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre brushed off concerns by claiming the president's health was fine and that he simply misspoke, which "happens to all of us."</p><p>But that same week, in a similar blunder, Biden also confused France's Emmanuel Macron for former French president Fran√ßois Mitterrand in his recollection of a summit from his first year in office.</p><p>In addition to numerous errors during speeches, Biden further concerned voters during his appearance at the June 2024 debate against Donald Trump, with many viewers concerned that the president appeared to struggle with a raspy voice and slurred, stumbled speech.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>This is literal elder abuse‚Ä¶ ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è <a href=#>#biden</a> <a href=#>#trump</a> <a href=#>#debate</a> <a href=#>#Debates2024</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/h1z1aEnHNj</a></p>‚Äî Andy Signore (@andysignore) <a href=#>June 28, 2024</a></figure><p>A neurosurgeon who spoke to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fox News</a> noted of Biden ‚Äî who has previously undergone surgeries for two near-fatal brain aneurysms he had back in 1988 ‚Äî that "[t]he odds have been stacked against him for years, long before his presidency."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfn7ymecGim56mXZ2yorjToQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jeremy-irvine-html.html><span>‚Üê</span><span>Jeremy Irvine - Age, Family, Bio</span></a>
