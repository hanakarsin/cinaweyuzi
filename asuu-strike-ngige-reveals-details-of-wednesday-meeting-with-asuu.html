One of the new areas is the renegotiation of the Conditions of Service, which is called the `2009 Agreement’.</p><p>“An agreement was reached in 2009 that their Conditions of Service would be reviewed every five years. It was done in 2014.</p><p>“We started one in which the former UNILAG Pro-Chancellor, Wale Babalakin (SAN), was chairing the committee.</p><p>“After Babalakin, Prof. Manzali was in charge and the committee came up with a draft document, proposed by the Federal Ministry of Education and ASUU.</p><p>“Today, Manzali’s committee has become defunct because many of the people in the committee are no longer pro-chancellors,” the minister explained.</p><p>Ngige said that a new team had been constituted to review the content of the document before a presentation is made to the Federal Executive Council and other relevant bodies for approval.</p><p>“This is to make sure that some of the allowances are not against the National Salaries, Incomes and Wages Commission (NSIWC) fixed rates for wages and allowances.</p><p>“If you propose allowances that do not comply with NSIWC rates, the government will not be able to accept it.</p><p>“So, it is important that they do the right thing from the beginning so that whatever the committee presents can be approved by the Federal Executive Council,’’ he said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH10e49rZpqrpap6tMDRoqKeZZ6ctqixjKucr52RocBusMStmKKko2K8p3nWnpunnaOZrrp5zJ6craGenHq4tdOhZJqrpap8</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./350081-coronavirus-uhuru-apiga-marufuku-safari-za-kutoka-na-kuingia-kaunti-za-nairobi-mombasa-na-kilifi-html.html><span>←</span><span>Coronavirus: Uhuru apiga marufuku safari za kutoka na kuingia Nairobi na kaunti zingine 3</span></a>
