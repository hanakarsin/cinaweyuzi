Knowledge of writing good business letters is a vital skill in any business industry; this is because it assists the company in creating a favorable impression of its company as well as its staff. With that said, the following article will provide a detailed step-by-step procedure on how to write an employment confirmation letter correctly.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/d822555154126bb7.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>A comprehensive guide on how to write reminder email effectively</span></p></a><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: How to write a recommendation letter - format and best practices</strong></p><h2>Who should write the employment confirmation letter?</h2><p class=align-left>When drafting an Employment confirmation letter sample, an employer must put attention on the positive impact of the workers’ updates. Generally, proof of employment letters is written by bosses on behalf of their personnel. But in some instances, employees will write the employment letter by themselves and take it to their superior so that they can sign or modify it to their liking. One benefit of the employer writing the employment verification letter is that it gives it a genuine and authentic feel. The disadvantage of the other end is that bosses often have a busy schedule and may not get the time to indulge in a time-consuming exercise.</p><p class=align-left>The best part about writing one’s employment confirmation letter is that you are in a position to control the information conveyed to the addressee, and it saves time as you will not need first to relay the ideas to your boss. The only downside of writing the letter for self is that your employer may refuse to sign off on what you write in the employment verification document. If that is the case, then you will spend more editing the letter, or you might be forced to wait for your employer to write on your behalf.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/a3e229129e527aa2.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Complete guide to writing an effective appointment letter</span></p></a><h2>How to write an employment confirmation letter</h2><p class=align-left>Below are some of the important details that you should put in mind in writing a verification of an employment letter.</p><h3>1. Purpose of writing an employment verification letter</h3><p class=align-left>Before you embark on writing an employment confirmation letter, you need to ask your employee on the central purpose; to ensure that the information drafted meets the requirements of its recipient. Moreover, the purpose will determine the letter’s content and tone to use. For instance, when the letter addresses to a financial institution for loan purposes, then it must use a professional tone and include the entire worker’s financial data like salaries, bonuses, commissions, and increments. On the other end, if the letter features a worker applying for new jobs, then it can use a friendly tone, and no financial information is required.</p><h3>2. Obtain all the necessary information</h3><p class=align-left>Once you are aware of the recipient of the employment verification letter, you must gather all the needed information so that you can write a comprehensive letter.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/cc0380835bed8a28.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>A step by step guide for writing an awesome attachment letter</span></p></a><h3>3. Keep it concise</h3><p class=align-left>An employment verification letter must be short and concise. Do not include any unnecessary details that may not be of use to the recipient. For example, if the purpose of the letter is for loan procurement, then there is no need to include the personnel’s work evaluation including their financial information is vital.</p><h3>4. Use an official business letter format</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/d822555154126bb7.jpeg><p class=align-left>As earlier mentioned, proof of employment letters are official documents; hence, you need to use the correct format when writing it; this includes having the following crucial segments;</p><h4>i. Company letter head</h4><p class=align-left>All employment verification letters must begin with the company letterhead as it legitimizes the document and makes the recipient trust its contents. If you are the boss writing this letter for your staff, then getting the letterhead should not be a problem. However, if you’re the employee, then you need to ask for permission to use the organization’s official letterhead. In case the company you are working for does not have a letterhead in place, then all you need to include is the name of the organization, address, phone contacts, email address, name and title of the person writing the letter and the date.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/3881ea1f874b263d.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to write an application letter for employment</span></p></a><h4>ii. Addressing the letter</h4><p class=align-left>The proper salutation is of utmost importance when writing an official letter and an employment verification letter is no different. When you are familiar with the recipient, address the letter to them. However, if the addressee is unknown to you then address it to the company generally and include a reference to explain the purpose of the letter. An example of a salutation when the recipient is unknown is like ‘To Whom It May Concern’ with an attention line such as ‘Employment Confirmation for (Name of Staff) for Loan Procurement.’</p><h4>iii. The body of the letter</h4><p class=align-left>In the first paragraph of the document, introduce yourself and the purpose of writing the letter. Also, remember to include your position at the company as well as how long you have held the post. Remember to include for how long you have known the employee you are referencing in the letter. In case you are writing the letter yourself, draft it as if it’s coming from your boss since he will be the one signing off it at the bottom.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/0fgjhshsnik3ehqfo.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to write an expression of interest letter</span></p></a><p class=align-left>On the second paragraph of the body provide all the relevant details of the employee including dates of employment, a post held, whether they still work there or not, and also include if they held a permanent or temporary position. If needed the staff financial details should include in this paragraph.</p><p class=align-left>Use the third paragraph to explain the employee’s responsibilities at the organization. This section is vital is the staff is seeking for work in another organization. Even though an employment verification letter is merely for proof of employment and not a recommendation letter, you can still provide some positive feedback about the employee.</p><h4>iv. Include your contact details</h4><p class=align-left>In the final section of the letter offer to respond to any additional queries and provide a means of contact for the addressee such as your mobile number or email address.</p><h4>v. Sign off the letter</h4><p class=align-left>Always end the letter with Sincerely, Best Regards and then include a handwritten signature and your professional occupation. Moreover, remember to use official stamps or any other verification used at your company for formal letters.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/0fgjhs3s0js8hk8og.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Different styles used to write letters</span></p></a><h3>5.
