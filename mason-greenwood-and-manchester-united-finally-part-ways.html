The best decision for us all is for me to continue my football career away from Old Trafford, where my presence will not be a distraction for the club. I thank the club for their support since I joined aged seven. There will always be a part of me that is United.</p><p>“I am enormously grateful to my family and all my loved ones for their support, and it is now for me to repay the trust those around me have shown. I intend to be a better footballer, but most importantly a good father, a better person, and to use my talents in a positive way on and off the pitch.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpjZH15e5FqZqaZo6S7brPRnpynr5%2BksW6tzZ1kppmemLWmv9OeqWatnp7BprCMn6CnmZyhxm68wKurZq%2BRrsBw</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./how-to-evolve-inkay-in-pokemon-go.html><span>←</span><span>Inkay Might Be One of the Strangest Pokmon to Evolve, Including in 'Pokmon Go'</span></a>
