Her military background makes her a great private investigator, too, much to the annoyance of the local police force. But no one can argue that her assertive style doesn't get good results.</p><p>But many fans are wondering whether the series will be able to make it to next season, especially considering it's not exactly killing it as far as ratings go. And while ratings aren't everything, they certainly provide a good indicator as to whether or not it will come back.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: ABC</span></figure><p>After a lot of speculation about how the future of Stumptown was on the fence for ABC, it was renewed back in May of 2020.

Because the showrunner also changed in between the seasons, there were allegedly issues with getting the scripts completed in time as well.&nbsp;</p><p>Other shows that were originally renewed but were later canceled because of the pandemic include I Am Not Okay with This and The Society on Netflix.&nbsp;</p><p>While the aforementioned shows appear to be dead in the water, there are reports circulating that Stumptown is getting shopped around to other networks and streaming services.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: ABC</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Cobie Smulders dished on what fans could expect from Season 2 before 'Stumptown' was canceled.</h2><p>Prior to the series' cancellation, Cobie discussed her excitement to get back to the Stumptown set to shoot Season 2 with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Green Matters</a>. The actress's tease for new storylines will really have fans wishing that the show gets a new life on another platform.&nbsp;</p><p>"I would love to get back to work," Cobie said with a laugh. "We're in the midst of writing and having this time. One of the positive things of this time is it enables us to really get creative with our scripts, take some time with our scripts, and really come up with cool, interesting stories."</p><p>The HIMYM alum noted that the show was also going to have a new and fresh vibe for its second season.&nbsp;</p><p>"I think it's gonna be, I mean I'm actually really excited about it, I can't really reveal too much and also we're still in process, but I think it’s gonna feel totally much different and much cooler. And the whole show has an opportunity to elevate itself because we have this crazy amount of preparation time before we hopefully get in front of the camera and can be in a room together again," she explained.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: ABC</span></figure><p>The Deadline report also shared that ABC Signature, the studio behind Stumptown, was looking to find a new streaming service or network for the show.&nbsp;</p><p>For fans who have grown attached to Dex, Grey, and the other Stumptown characters, there's still some hope that we'll be back in Portland and the Bad Alibi soon enough.
