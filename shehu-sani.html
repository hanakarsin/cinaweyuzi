And, as it is always the case where the will of the general electorate is subverted, the best candidates for the tasks at hand never get recruited.</p><p>“Our decision to adopt direct primaries in Kaduna State is the panacea to the deep fault lines and obstacles to building a strong virile, people-rooted APC.“Direct primaries is the most assured means at throwing up the most popular candidates that will deliver Kaduna State for the APC come 2019.’’</p><p>“Over the past three years, there had been a significant amount of disquiet in the camp of the APC in the state, &nbsp;resulting to a disturbing level as apathy and anomie now pervade the party as a result of the profound sense of marginalisation,’’ it said.</p><p>The group said that many critical stakeholders, as well as members of the party,&nbsp; had faced outright exclusion in some instances.</p><p>“The delegate system, otherwise called indirect primaries, &nbsp;will rely on the whims and caprices of the few that now control the party after emerging from the ward, local government and state congresses that have been widely rejected by party members as a sham.</p><p>“Hundreds of party members who bought forms with a view to vying for various wards, local governments and state party executive positions were deliberately excluded from the process and in some instances even intentionally blocked from submitting their forms,’’ it added.</p><p>Signatories to the letter apart from Sani (APC-Kaduna Central), who is seeking a second term, &nbsp;included Halal Falal, a gubernatorial aspirant. Others include &nbsp;Mohammed Sani, who is aspiring to represent &nbsp;Kaduna Central Senatorial District, Aliyu Silver, aspiring to represent Kaduna North Senatorial District and Rufai Chanchangu, the member representing Kaduna South Federal Constituency.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGirqKGTZKCpsceuZIyZnp58</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./peter-obi-reacts-to-ibadan-bomb-explosion.html><span>←</span><span>Peter Obi Reacts To Ibadan Bomb Explosion</span></a>
