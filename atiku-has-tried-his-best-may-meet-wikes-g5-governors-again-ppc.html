Unfortunately, our candidate is being made to face this kind of situation. Even though he has nothing to do with their demand (Ayu’s resignation), he has on many occasions, reached out to these aggrieved parties for a truce. You can’t be open to reconciliation and yet, you are not ready to shift ground. It doesn’t work that way.”</p><h2>Removing Ayu Is Beyond Atiku’s Power</h2><p>On his part, the immediate past National Secretary of the PDP and a member of the party’s National Executive Committee, Senator <strong>Ibrahim Tsauri,</strong> said what Governor Wike and his allies were demanding is beyond Atiku’s reach.</p><p>He said the presidential candidate had done his best to reconcile with the Wike-led group, all to no avail.</p><p>Also speaking, the spokesperson of the Atiku/Okowa Presidential Campaign Organization, Charles Aniagwu said the reconciliation is dragging on because the governors had yet to realise that what they were asking Atiku to do with the removal of Ayu was beyond his powers.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH5ze49sZpqsmaDCbrTArGStqpmasW60yKxkm52jqXqurdhmpJ6dpGLEqrfErGSgbV2cvLex0aemq6tdlrSitc1mp6mbXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./apc-declares-edo-state-primary-election-inconclusive-amid-controversies.html><span>←</span><span>APC Declares Edo State Primary Election Inconclusive Amid Controversies</span></a>
