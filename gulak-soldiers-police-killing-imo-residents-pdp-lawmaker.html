We lost a young man and the family has written to the Nigerian army. But I want to tell you that we the people of Aboh Mbaise are not happy with it. As the representative of my people, for us, I want to make it known to the world that we are waiting for the outcome of that petition.”</p><p>Eke further alleged that many shops have been destroyed in the area, adding that his constituents are innocent and have no hand in Gulak’s murder.</p><p>He added: “I am giving the Nigerian army 14 days to respond to the killing of that gentleman, who left a pregnant and expectant mother, that is, his wife, then two children — one is three years old, one is two years old. What will become of those children?</p><p>“The question we are asking security agents is, why are you after my people? That the man was killed close to the airport — we host the airport — does that mean we are the killers of Gulak? The answer is no.</p><p>“We are not killers, but if anything happens on our land, the police should take their time to investigate and unravel the perpetrators of these crimes. I have pictures, I have videos of people being killed. Our people can no longer sleep in their houses.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH13e49tZqCtnJa4br%2FOpZuinaKoerG7y6KanmWbnrmttc2gZKKln2K%2Fpr%2FInZynrKNivaW8jKWYsKWRoLKzew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ed-parker-html.html><span>←</span><span>Ed Parker - Trivia, Family, Bio</span></a>
