We shall tell the electorate what our party has done and also remind them of the enviable records set by our Presidential Candidate Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu and his running mate Senator Kashim Shettima during their previous assignments. They have demonstrated the capacity, experience, composure, exposure and acceptance to take Nigeria to greater heights from May 29th 2023.</p><p>“While others spend their valuable time addressing personalities and other frivolities, let us stay with the mission and vision of our candidate and the party, as encapsulated in the Action Plan. This singular focus will enable us deliver the dividends of democracy to Nigerians.”</p><p>While expressing optimism that the APC would emerge victorious at the polls, Lalong called on all party stakeholders to unite and work together at all levels.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH5xe5FrZmtoYmh6ra3LqKWgZZieu7W%2FjJqrZpmgmHq0wNGaq56fqWLBsHnWoqVmamBngG680Z6qopyVo7C6ecWoqWasmaPCo8GO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./killing-of-34-persons-in-southern-kaduna-barbaric-el-rufai.html><span>←</span><span>Killing Of 34 Persons In Southern Kaduna Barbaric</span></a>
