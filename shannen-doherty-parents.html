Her father, John, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">worked at a bank</a>, and her mother owned a beauty parlor. In 1978, when Shannen was 7 years old, the family moved to Los Angeles so that her father could start a west coast branch of the family transportation business.</p><p>It was just a few years later that Shannen would begin her career in entertainment. Her first big role was on the series Father Murphy when Shannen was 10 years old.</p><p>Her parents didn't have a lot of time in the spotlight, but they were there to support her throughout her career. John even came to cheer her on when Shannen competed on <a href=#>Dancing With the Stars</a>.</p><p>A scroll through <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Shannen's Instagram account</a> shows that she also spent a lot of time with her mother, Rosa.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram/@theshando</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Shannen's father also dealt with difficult health issues before his death in 2010.</h2><p>Shannen spoke about how difficult it was seeing her father struggled with his health on her podcast, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Let's Be Clear With Shannen Doherty</a>. On Father's Day in 2024, she shared that his own health battles may have influenced the type of men she sought out for relationships.</p><p>“I think watching him go in and out of the hospital and the fear that I constantly felt of, is this going to be the last time I see him? Is he going to die? Is he not going to come out of the hospital?” she said.</p><p>“But it wasn't like he was doing that to me. It was more that I was projecting that onto myself because I was so scared that the most important man in my life was not going to be there, that there was parts of me that sort of shut down as I got older. And I think I definitely, we've discussed this before, you guys, where I chose men that were not like my dad, that were not that kind and that gracious and that great.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqLWius2epWacn52ys8DYZqeaqpWjwbQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./314063-serikali-yafunga-shule-15-kwenye-msitu-wa-mau-huku-ikiwafurusha-walio-ndani-html.html><span>←</span><span>Serikali yafunga shule 15 kwenye msitu wa Mau huku ikiwafurusha walio ndani</span></a>
