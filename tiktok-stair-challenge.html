That‚Äôs not the case with the Stair Challenge, though.</p><p>It only took watching a single Stair Challenge video on TikTok to decide that, no, actually, we can‚Äôt do that one. We won‚Äôt deny that it‚Äôs super impressive, though! Here‚Äôs everything you need to know about the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Stair Challenge</u></a> (and a reminder that just because something is going viral on TikTok, that doesn‚Äôt mean you have to participate in it ‚Äî&nbsp;especially if you‚Äôre going to get hurt trying to do it).</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@mattsteffanina href=#>@mattsteffanina</a><p>miss a step, lose an ankle ü§£ ignore the photo shoot behind us... @vansecoo <a title=stairchallenge href=#>##stairchallenge</a> <a title=shuffle href=#>##shuffle</a></p><a title="‚ô¨ #PlankChallenge - chisa2122" href=#>‚ô¨ #PlankChallenge - chisa2122</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">TikTok‚Äôs Stair Challenge is harder than it looks.</h2><p>If you spend a few minutes watching Stair Challenge videos on TikTok, it quickly becomes clear what the challenge actually is. At first, it seems simple: do a shuffle step up a flight of stairs (and make sure to use the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>PlankChallenge - chisa2122 audio</u></a> in the video). To be fair, plenty of people seem to have completed the challenge with ease. We‚Äôre just not totally sure how.</p><p>If you ask us, the Stair Challenge seems like a great way to seriously injure yourself, but that hasn‚Äôt stopped plenty of people from participating in it. If you search the #stairchallenge tag on TikTok, there are tons of videos of people successfully completing the challenge. Videos with the #stairchallenge tag have more than 250 million views. If you‚Äôre looking for a way to take your TikTok virality to the next level, this might be the challenge for you!</p><p>The good news is that even if you can‚Äôt successfully make your way up a flight of stairs while dancing, you could still be popular on TikTok. In fact, it seems like a lot of the most-viewed Stair Challenge videos on TikTok are of people failing. Hard. We don‚Äôt know who needs to hear this, but hard stairs plus socks plus dancing is a really, really bad idea.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@marifranking href=#>@marifranking</a><p>Well, stair challenge is harder than it looks <a title=stairchallenge href=#>##stairchallenge</a> <a title=mombomb href=#>##mombomb</a> <a title=oopsy href=#>##oopsy</a> <a title=lol href=#>##lol</a> <a title=stayhomestaystrong href=#>##stayhomestaystrong</a> <a title=stairshuffle href=#>##stairshuffle</a> <a title=mom href=#>##mom</a> <a title=fails href=#>##fails</a> <a title=ouch href=#>##ouch</a></p><a title="‚ô¨ #PlankChallenge - chisa2122" href=#>‚ô¨ #PlankChallenge - chisa2122</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">There‚Äôs at least one other variation on the Stair Challenge.</h2><p>Sometimes, two (or more) different challenges use the same name on TikTok, so you get a little bit of overlap when you‚Äôre searching through tags. We were able to find another version of the Stair Challenge which looks maybe a bit more doable (but still pretty dangerous). For this Stair Challenge, you‚Äôre supposed to attempt walking down a flight of stairs. Sounds easy enough, right?</p><p>Well, that‚Äôs not the only part of the challenge. You have to get down the stairs while viewing them through the Whirpool camera effect on TikTok. The effect makes it virtually impossible to see where the next step is ‚Äî&nbsp;exactly what you want when taking your life into your own hands, right?</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@heavenmuncy href=#>@heavenmuncy</a><p><a title=whirlpool href=#>##whirlpool</a> <a title=stairchallenge href=#>##stairchallenge</a></p><a title="‚ô¨ original sound - heavenmuncy" href=#>‚ô¨ original sound - heavenmuncy</a></figure><p>As much as we enjoy watching both types of Stair Challenge videos, we‚Äôre pretty sure we‚Äôre just going to keep enjoying them from afar. On the couch.
