As Kenyans we can have our political differences but this should not lead us to the kind of conflicts and divisions that we are witnessing now," he advised.<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/720/de41dc4f7ce43f17.jpeg><p class=align-left><strong>PAY ATTENTION: </strong>Click 'See First' under 'Follow' Tab to see Tuko.co.ke news on your FB feed</p><p class=align-left>The sentiments were echoed by Lurambi MP Titus Khamala who is also a bishop.</p>"We are at a very critical stage in our country and we need peace. Let democracy prevail and if for instance you do like the DP (Ruto) just let him sell his ideas peacefully without interference. I am putting goons on notice here who think they can stop other people's rallies that we will deal with them," he said in his constituency.<p class=align-left>Ruto who has been crisscrossing the country championing his 'hustler' tag said it was time to have a new conversation in Kenya.</p>"The lords of tribalism and poverty who are masters/beneficiaries of political violence are very mad at the unbowed hustler movement. Why? The hustlers have refused the tribe configuration and instead they want a conversation on their individual hustles which are tribeless," he opined.<p class=align-left><strong><i>Do you have a groundbreaking story you would like us to publish?
