If I were the leader of the party, I would have acted differently. I would have done things differently. He has done a lot of damage to the PDP and I don’t know what they are waiting for to show him the way out.”</p><p>Nwoko, speaking to his political ambition, said he would do better than he did in the House of Representatives in 1999, adding that the hallmark of a good legislator is the ability to lobby.</p><p>”A good lawmaker is almost as good as someone with executive power. It is all about lobbying. Normally our focus is on the well-being of Nigeria. As a senator, I will be representing Nigeria whether you are in PDP, APC or Labour Party. It doesn’t make any difference to me. If you look at the bills I sponsored when I was in the House of Representatives, it was all about the people. It was about the minimum wage, the disability allowance and many others like that.</p><p>“Coming down to Delta, the Benin/Asaba road needs to be resurfaced, we also need service stations along the way,” he added.</p><p>Meanwhile, <strong>Naija News</strong> earlier reported that the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) G-5 on Monday commissioned some projects executed by the administration of Governor Samuel Ortom of Benue State.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Naija News</strong></a> learnt that the projects were commissioned by the Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike, Seyi Makinde (Oyo State), Okezie Ikpeazu (Abia State), Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi (Enugu State).</p><p>The inauguration of the projects was held at separate locations in Makurdi the state capital.</p><p>The projects commissioned by the Governors on Monday include five different roads and electrification projects.</p><p>These roads include the 9.4 km Tse- Poor Apir Road renamed Ayua Num road executed at 1.2 billion and the 7.7km Yaikyo- Tse Poor Road, now Chief Sule Abenga Road for 1.4 billion.</p><p>Others are the 2.0km George Akume-NKST Yina Road now to be known as Sen.
