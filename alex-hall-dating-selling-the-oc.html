Clearly, there was chemistry between those two, and at the end of Season 2, they made out during that steamy hot tub moment. But unfortunately, Alex and Tyler didn't end up together.</p><p>In Season 3, we see these flirty co-workers kiss again and seemingly hook up during a work trip to San Diego, but they never officially became a couple.</p><p>Fast forward to October 2023, when news broke that Tyler had left the Oppenheim Group. The following month, Alex appeared on the Selling Sunset Season 7 reunion, where host Tan France asked her about Tyler. "I did not know he was leaving until he pretty much left." She then revealed that Tyler had actually blocked her on Instagram and "excommunicated" her.</p><p>It goes without saying that they were over. And that was OK because Alex had seemingly moved on. While entertaining things with Tyler during Season 3, she was also seeing another man. Who is Alex dating, and are they still together? Here's what we know.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Who is Alex Hall dating?</h2><p>During Selling the OC Season 3, Alex revealed that she had been seeing a new guy who she claimed worked at TikTok as the Global Head of Marketing. Speaking to her co-stars Polly Brindle and Alexandra Rose about him, Alex said that they hadn't been seeing each other for long, but he was moving to London, meaning that their relationship would soon be long distance.</p><p>Throughout the season, Alex continued to spend time privately with him, going with him on a trip to Vegas and Europe. Tyler wasn't exactly thrilled to see Alex move on.</p><p>During the season finale, Alex was getting ready to go on a trip to Italy with her new guy. Tyler told her that he didn't want her to go as he wanted to explore what was between, but it's unclear if she actually went.</p><p>Alex told Tyler that this new guy checked all the boxes. However, she also told Tyler that her relationship with him didn't have the chemistry that they had.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Alex Hall (@alexhalloc)</a></p></figure><p>In September 2023, Alex was spotted kissing an unknown man on the street per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a>, but his identity is unknown. It's possible that this could be the same guy she was speaking about during Season 3, which was filmed earlier in 2023.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Who is Alex Hall's ex-husband?</h2><p>Alex was previously married to a man named Neil Flores for seven years before calling it quits. The exes share two children together: a daughter, Gia, whom Alex had at age 19, and a son whose name is not publicly known.</p><p>Very little is known about Alex's ex-husband, Neil, but they were divorced before Selling the OC started. During Season 1 of the show, Alex was seen on a date with a man named Jeremy, but hinted that she was too busy to pursue anything serious and he was never seen again on the show.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Alex Hall (@alexhalloc)</a></p></figure><p>Selling the OC Season 3 is now streaming on Netflix.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhflrmmxIyhmKWkXZmutbXNoGSsnZyhtq%2BzjK2fnmWfmA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./luke-lerdwichagul-html.html><span>←</span><span>SMG4 - Age, Family, Bio</span></a>
