I wish other women will come out and show you before and their after. Don't use the fact that you failed deceive others.<p class=align-left>@NwanyiNkwobi also stated her opinion, saying:</p>Whatever you guys like, tweet. I will one day be loved and understood by an Igbo king. I will love him and be his peace and he will be my rock and sweetness. We will have kids and bring them up in the way of the Lord.
