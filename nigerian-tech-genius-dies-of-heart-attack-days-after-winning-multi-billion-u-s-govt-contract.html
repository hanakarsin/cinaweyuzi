My heart is broken. He had a cardiac arrhythmia/heart attack in his sleep. He was fully vaccinated and did not have Covid. He and I were so close. He was only 42.</p><p>“David was kind, gentle, brilliant, and humble.</p><p>“He had a Ph.D. in Computer Engineering and was a Kaggle Grandmaster, the highest attainable skill level in practical Machine Learning. He introduced me to Al.</p><p>“The algorithm he wrote for automatically detecting threats at Airports just won a $125 Million contract from Department of Homeland security about 1 wk ago. His code beat out companies backed by Billions of dollars. So, in the future when you safely fly the skies, please remember my brother David.</p><p>“Our hearts are broken. My poor parents, his wife, and two young children. His 4 siblings. We are devastated.</p><p>“David and I were tremendously aligned in our interests and would often talk for hours. Our connection was rare and precious. We ended phone conversations with “love you”.</p><p>“Hug your loved ones and tell them you love them.</p><p>“Though there may be sorrow in the night, joy comes in the morning. I’m comforted that David is with our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.”</p><p>See more photo of late David;</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.naijanews.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/11-21.jpg alt width=444 height=337 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH16e5BuZqehl5q%2Fqq3NZquem5hitKa6yK6qZpyZmsBuu8Vmn56Zoql6osDTmpqkZZSWxrR5wJ%2BrnqpdrLavusinnmalpaHBqnnBoqOloZ%2BjerZ50maeqK6kYrCwutOrmJysXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./295008-mwanamke-muranga-ajiua-nyumbani-kwa-wazazi-wake-baada-ya-kutoroka-kwa-mumewe-html.html><span>←</span><span>Mwanamke Muranga ajiua nyumbani kwa wazazi wake baada ya kutoroka kwa mumewe</span></a>
