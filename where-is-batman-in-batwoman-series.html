In this new Gotham, Batman is nowhere to be found and is no longer the protector of the city. The series explores what happens after Batman has hung up his cowl.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: CW</span></figure><p>When an Alice in Wonderland-style villain, Alice (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rachel Skarsten</a>), comes onto the scene and kidnaps an officer who happens to be Kate's love interest, Sophie (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Meagan Tandy</a>), Kate decides she has to do everything in her power to get her back. Searching for answers, she finds herself at her missing cousin Bruce Wayne's office. It's there that she stumbles her way to the Bat Cave and finds the Batman suit.&nbsp;</p><p>Kate makes the decision to change the suit for herself and to take up the mantle as the protector of Gotham. Throughout the season, she'll make the mantle <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">more her own</a>, as she's initially mistaken for a returning Batman and she decides that she's "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">not about to let a man take credit for a woman's work</a>."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: CW</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">So where is Batman in the new Batwoman series?</h2><p>Batman is missing in action and there's a very important reason for that: the CW doesn't have the rights to Batman.&nbsp;</p><p>DC does allow the CW a lot of rights with their characters, considering that the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Arrowverse</a> consists of characters from Green Arrow, Supergirl, and The Flash. But the strictest rules always came from the Batman universe. They were able to have characters from the Batman universe, but never the more prominent ones or the city of Gotham itself.</p><p>When Gotham premiered on FOX, they were granted a bit more leeway and were able to say the name of the city on screen. They also had a bit of fun <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">saying names like "Bruce Wayne"</a> which had previously been banned to them.&nbsp;</p><p>With Batwoman, they are now bringing their own Gotham to life and they are able to say Batman, but they still lack the rights to actually include him as a character, although the show's creator Caroline Dries does hope to one day <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">be able to break down that wall.</a>&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: CW</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">So what characters can they have on the show?</h2><p>In addition to Batwoman and Alice, quite a few other superheroes and villains have been confirmed to return for Batwoman. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tyler Hoechlin</a> and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Elizabeth Tulloch</a> have signed on for at least an episode each meaning that Arrowverse's Superman and Lois Lane will be making an appearance. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Katherine McNamara</a> will also be reprising her role as Mia Smoak and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Caity Lotz</a> is returning as Sara Lance, aka White Canary.&nbsp;</p><p>Since this is Arrowverse, it seems likely that more characters from Batwoman's sister shows will make more appearances as time goes on. But as far as Batman goes, the door is closed to the Caped Crusader, for now.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWmvsRmoKxlkpbBrq3NZqCnZZKWwbi7zJqlZquVp7amvw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./403962-mombasa-walioenda-kulipa-mahari-wapigwa-na-butwaa-kulimwa-faini-html.html><span>←</span><span>Mombasa: Walioenda kulipa mahari wapigwa na butwaa kulimwa faini</span></a>
