The two Deputy National Chairmen are no longer in office. The next most senior party office: should be the Secretary-General of the party.</p><p>But as we all know. The erstwhile National Secretary in the person of Hon. Buni Mai Main is now the Executive Governor of Yobe State. Hence, as the Acting National Secretary, I have the Constitutional Power to steer activities of our great party.</p><p>“By Article 14.4 (i) of the Constitution of our great party.
