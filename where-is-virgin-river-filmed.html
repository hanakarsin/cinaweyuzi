The city's <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">tourism site</a> offers a detailed itinerary for viewers who are interested in checking out the scenic spots themselves.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><p>Agassiz, Squamish, and Port Coquitlam are all places that have been used in the drama.</p><p>When scenes take place outdoors, Snug Cove on Bowen Island (just off the coast of Vancouver) is often used as the backdrop.</p><p>And while interior scenes of Jack's bar are shot on a set, the exterior is a real place: The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Watershed Grill</a> in Brackendale.</p><p>On the show, Vernon "Doc" Mullins has a medical practice in a historic home. The real house was built in 1889 and is located at <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">122 First Street in New Westminster</a>. The home last sold in August of 2021 for $2.15 million.</p><p>The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">facade of Mel's log cabin</a> is also a spot that fans can check out in Murdo Frazer Park. The park's caretaker lives in the cabin full-time, but the exterior has been used in other shows such as Once Upon a Time, Supernatural, and The Flash.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Will 'Virgin River' return for Season 5?</h2><p>Virgin River fans can continue enjoying the show’s stunning views for another season: Netflix released all of Season 4 on July 20, 2022. The season picks up where the last one left off, when Mel discovers that <a href=#>she's pregnant</a> and doesn’t know if the father is Jack or her deceased husband, Mark (Daniel Gillies).</p><p>After binging the entire season in one sitting, now all we can think about is a <a href=#>Season 5</a>. Thankfully we know that Virgin River has been renewed for another season and is already in production! If the show sticks to its previous schedule, we should expect Season 5 to be released in the summer of 2023. We're not sure we can wait that long to get our Virgin River fix, so we might just have to take a trip to Vancouver to see the sites for ourselves!</p><p>Virgin River is available to stream on Netflix now.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWmvsRmoKxlpp6%2FqLXNZqmirpWneqe1y6acnQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./julius-agwu.html><span>←</span><span>Read All The Latest News About Julius Agwu On Naija News</span></a>
