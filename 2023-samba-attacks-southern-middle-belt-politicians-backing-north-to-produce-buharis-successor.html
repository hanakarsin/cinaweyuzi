Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), on the grounds that it was the turn of the North to produce the president then. For this reason, it is hypocritical to deny the South its turn at the Presidency.</p><p>“If we recall, the threat and demand for a president of northern extraction were so strong that the members of the then ruling party, the Peoples Democratic Party were unable to campaign openly for any southern candidates in the North.</p><p>“So, this begs the question; how is it now that some southerners and Middle-Belters are against the power shift to the South?” the group asked.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH5xe5BrZmtoYmh6tK3Mm5hmmaSprqS30maqqK2knbKzuoymoJ2cnJp6o7HLrWSpp5yewaqvyJqlrGWSlrCstc2gZKenoqm1bsDOZqerp5SqsKZ5wa6fmqqZqHq0wcKcnKyrn6d8</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./i-love-it-html.html><span>←</span><span>I Love It - Artist, Ages, Trivia</span></a>
