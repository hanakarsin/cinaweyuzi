You will all be so disappointed with yourselves and your premature celebration when you see my next tweet. I am, after all, the #TableShaker! You guys are so easy to manipulate. They just yank your chain and you drink kunu.”</p><p>Omokri added in another post: “After I tweet, somebody should please go and check on that bitter leaf boardroom and possible bedroom partner of that beautiful hypocrite, to make sure she does not drink sniper tonight. You know yourself. I could have tweeted since. But I wanted to yank your chain.”</p><p>Stating his position on Jonathan’s alleged APC presidential form purchase, Omokri tweeted: “First of all, to whet your appetite, let me say that under the rain and under the sun, I will follow Jonathan. Secondly, I can’t ever be one with APC. Thirdly, nobody can shave HE @GEJonathan’s head in his absence. Read between the lines. More to come!”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH12e49yZqiln6C%2FqnnRnpicrKNirrR5yailmqyYlrtuvMicoqxlkaWwbn6Pa2pmqKKawKqwxKeropmcYrOwvsxmqZ6ulZa5tHnIp6ueqpWowaq6xmadmpukqHw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./fuel-scarcity-ipman-reveals-when-petrol-will-be-available.html><span>←</span><span>IPMAN Reveals When Petrol Will Be Available</span></a>
