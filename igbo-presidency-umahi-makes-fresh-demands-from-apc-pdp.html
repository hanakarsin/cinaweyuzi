But I can’t say what I will do. It depends on what God places in my mind,” he added.</p><p>Speaking further, the governor dismissed reports that he dumped the PDP for the APC to push for the zoning of the presidency to the Southeast.</p><p>According to Umahi, he joined the APC because of the support President Muhammadu Buhari gave to his state despite being in opposition.</p><p>He said: “Remember when I joined APC, I didn’t join APC because I needed to insist that the south-east must be the next president. I never did.</p><p>“I joined APC with all my heart and the support of Mr President, and an appreciation for all his support, even when I was in the other party, and also to prove that the Igbo man believes so much in one Nigeria.</p><p>“That is the reason I joined APC, apart from my protest of the injustice meted to the south-east in PDP.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH16e49tZqKfkqR6sb7ErKCdnZ6Yxm7BzJqfomWdlrimv4yfqZ6rmGKxprnAp5usZZanvK55wKmaZqiUpXw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./just-in-orji-kalu-withdraws-from-2023-presidential-race-gives-reason.html><span>←</span><span>Orji Kalu Withdraws From 2023 Presidential Race, Gives Reason</span></a>
