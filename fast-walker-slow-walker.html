The myriad of tourists, street performers, selfie-taking nerds, and costumed street performers extorting people for money was a nightmare.</p><p>But stationery people were easy to bypass, the worst are those who clog up the sidewalks with their snail-pace walking.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p><a href=#>via GIPHY</a></p></figure><p>There are tons of ways to deal with slow walkers. You can dart around them the second there's an opening if you're not in the mood to employ the ringing bell strategy like up above. Or you can mock their slow pace while trudging behind them to at least entertain yourself as you're late to whatever appointment you have.</p><p>But what happens when you, a fast walker, encounter another fast walker who's slightly slower than you are? You need to pass this person because you don't want to be that awkward kind of close walker who just lulls behind an individual, making them uncomfortable.</p><p>Something that Twitter user Gabe Rivera brought up online which started a whole conversation of the nature of fast walking dos and don'ts.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>You know how when you're a fast walker and the guy ahead of you is fast too but only 90% as fast as you, so you MUST pass him, but to pass him you have to walk comically faster than your normal speed, or else you'll be in his personal space too long as you pass? That's annoying.</p>— Gabe Rivera (@gaberivera) <a href=#>January 17, 2018</a></figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>the worst</p>— Ben Thompson (@benthompson) <a href=#>January 17, 2018</a></figure><p>There are rules about personal space.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>And social norms seem to make the entire width of the sidewalk the other person’s personal space. Sometimes you just have to step off the curb into the street.</p>— Matt McClure (@matthewlmcclure) <a href=#>January 17, 2018</a></figure><p>And even though you have to pretty much jog to get past them, Rivera argues it's an important move to shame people into getting out of the way.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>It's inconvenient, but a good way to let everyone else know how terribly slow they are.</p>— Gabe Rivera (@gaberivera) <a href=#>January 17, 2018</a></figure><p>I just don't understand why people don't follow the rules of road traffic when walking. If you want to be slow, stay on the left.</p><p>But standardizing a fast walker walking pace would be nice.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I live this truth every day.

Because men do this to women which is even more annoying</p>— Carolyn Penner (@cpen) <a href=#>January 17, 2018</a></figure><p>Now although this might seem like rare occurrence, it probably does happen a lot more than you think.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Ugh.

It's called <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"The Spirit of the Staircase."</a> Basically, you think of what you would've said at the party to that person just as you're leaving.</p><p>So why isn't there a word or phrase for fast walking frustration?</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>There must be a German word for this</p>— Richard Hendrix (@Drixer) <a href=#>January 17, 2018</a></figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=de dir=ltr>passenfreude. perhaps</p>— Mayank (@mayanknkc) <a href=#>January 17, 2018</a></figure><p>Regardless of what it's called, it's just such a nuanced act.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>There’s an art to the pass.
