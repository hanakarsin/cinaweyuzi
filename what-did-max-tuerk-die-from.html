His family released a terse statement, writing, "Max died on June 20, 2020 while hiking with his parents on a favorite trail in the Cleveland National Forest. Max loved his teammates, coaches, and schools. Max was a loving son and older brother and his passing leaves a giant hole in our hearts. His strength and work ethic is an inspiration to many."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: ESPN</span></figure><p>The USC Trojans official Twitter account shared the statement along with their own condolences for the loss of a stand out player. The college team's coach, Clay Helton wrote, "Heartbroken by the loss of Max Tuerk. Incredible person, teammate, and Trojan. Our thoughts and prayers go out to his family."</p><p>The team's former coach, Lane Kiffin also expressed his grief over the loss of Max, "This is awful. So sad. Praying for family and friends.

In 2012, Max was named a College freshman All-American and was then drafted to the All-Pac-12 first team as a college junior in 2014.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr><a href=#>#FightOnForever</a>, Max Tuerk.</p><p>The <a href=#>#TrojanFamily</a> is terribly saddened by the news of Tuerk‚Äôs passing, gone too soon at the age of 26, and our thoughts, prayers and condolences are with his family. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/PBzN1J55Ch</a></p>‚Äî USC Trojans (@USC_Athletics) <a href=#>June 21, 2020</a></figure><p>Unfortunately, he saw little playtime in his senior season: an ACL injury derailed his hopes for more field action.</p><p>Things began looking up for Max, however, when the San Diego chargers brought him on their squad as a third-round draft pick in 2016. He was selected as a "healthy scratch" for the time, meaning that while he was able to play, the NFL only allows 46 of a team's 53 players to actually dress and take the field.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>This is awful.

He tested positive for using performance-enhancing drugs (steroids), and was suspended without pay for the first four games of that season. The Chargers distanced themselves from the Lineman and eventually cut him from their roster.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Heartbroken by the loss of Max Tuerk.
