This is especially so given the fact that her husband, President Goodluck Jonathan, is in the Presidential race.</i></p><p><strong>READ ALSO:</strong>&nbsp;<a href=#>The Military Have Destroyed Boko Haram Command Center – Air Force</a></p><p><i>“Buhari’s general disdain for women and their opinion is well known. This is a man that said that he would scrap the office of the First Lady if he is elected President.</i></p><p><i>“If he is not ready to face public scrutiny and criticism for his often irresponsible, retrogressive, nonsensical and asinine views, he should quit the Presidential race and consider retiring from politics.</i></p><p><i>“Our counsel to the APC is as follows: leave the First Lady alone or prepare yourselves for a relentless verbal blitzkrieg, the likes of which you have never seen before.” </i>The Statement reads on Vanguard.</p><p>Meanwhile the <a href=#>APC has responded to Patience Jonathan's comments</a>. The party released a statement in which it&nbsp;said her utterances were&nbsp;“discourteous and inexcusable” for a wife of any president with a small indefinite quantity of decency to make such a fake and childish declaration about the health status of another man on account of politics.</p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkgHqDkGtrZp6Ro7Zut8Cypp2dXaiuur%2BMm6yhmaKeerOxwKWjsmWYlsBurYydnJqcXZe%2ForXNZ5%2BtpZw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-plays-dave-in-pretty-smart.html><span>←</span><span>Who Plays Dave in 'Pretty Smart'?</span></a>
