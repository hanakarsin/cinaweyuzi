And taking care of a child comes with major responsibility. So, it’s always important for parents to have a solid relationship with one another to achieve that goal. And history has shown that drama between parents can get in the way of children being taken care of appropriately.</p><p>Rapper <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ace Hood</a> (real name: Antoine McColister) has been very vocal about how much he loves his children. And when he was unable to spend time with them on Father’s Day, he shared his sentiments on social media. Now, many fans are wondering who his baby mama is and why there is so much drama between them. Get comfortable as we spill all of the tea.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Ace Hood’s baby mama, Shanice Tyria, claims that the rapper owes her $95,000 in child support.</h2><p>Ace Hood’s baby mama, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Shanice Tyria</a>, is not here for the rapper’s claims about not seeing his children on Father’s Day. After Ace shared his sentiments on social media, Shanice quickly chimed in with her reasoning. Messy!</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram</a></figure><p>In a lengthy Instagram video reposted on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Shade Room</a>, Shanice shared that the rapper not only owes her $95,000, but he’s acting out due to his reality show endeavors.</p><p>“You really tried to come on here and get these people to try and destroy my character,” Shanice said on Instagram Live. “For you and your wife to do that for a check for Love & Hip Hop? That is sad.”</p><p>Shanice also apparently wrote in an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram story</a>, seemingly about Ace: "When you about to join Love and Hip Hop Miami and need a storyline."</p><p>In her Instagram Live video, Shanice also put the rapper on blast for reportedly taking out a PPP loan for $144,000, but not being able to make good on his child support.&nbsp;</p><p>“We reported it so now he has to pay me what he owes me and he’s mad,” Shanice shared on Instagram Live. “I let you go two years without doing anything so what are you talking about? Make it make sense. And y’all can look up the PPP loan. Y’all know it’s public records. Ace Hood Touring. Go look it up, he got $144,000.”</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by The Shade Room (@theshaderoom)</a></p></figure><p>The news is unfortunate, especially since Shanice and Ace have had a cordial co-parenting relationship for the sake of their twin girls, Lyric and Sailor Blu.&nbsp;However, fans have been vocal about their opinions on the situation.</p><p>Some believe that Shanice is simply acting like a bitter baby mama, while others are saying that it is suspicious that Ace hasn't paid his child support. However, the general consensus is that Shanice's claims are serious enough to get Ace in trouble with the law, which is something she shouldn't want to see happen to the father of her children.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I’m glad Ace Hood got a nice wife bringing him peace cause his BM definitely trying to send homie to the feds.

With top-performing albums including “Gutta,” “Ruthless,” and “Blood Sweat & Tears,” Ace has established himself as a reputable hip-hop artist.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a> reports that Ace has accumulated a net worth of $5 million. This figure comes from his music landing in the Top 10 of the Billboard charts, successful mixtapes, and his work as a songwriter and producer.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram</a></figure><p>Despite the back-and-forth going on with Ace and Shanice, the rapper should be able to spend time with their children. And if Shanice is not mad about the money, her feelings toward Ace shouldn’t have anything to do with keeping their kids away from him.</p><p>Things have seemingly died down on social media, but there is no telling if Ace and Shanice have come to some sort of understanding. And for the sake of their kids, we hope they can get it together.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhflrCmeceopp1lkpavunnMmqSa</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./breaking-one-burnt-alive-many-security-agents-missing-as-bandit-terrorists-attack-sokoto.html><span>←</span><span>One Burnt Alive, Many Security Agents Missing As Bandit Terrorists Attack Sokoto</span></a>
