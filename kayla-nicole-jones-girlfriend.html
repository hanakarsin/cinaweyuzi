The internet thinks the meme queen popped out with a new girlfriend.</h2><p>On Wednesday, August 2, Kayla seemingly updated her relationship status with a viral photo of herself and another woman. She captioned the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Facebook</a> post, “Love.”</p><p>Later, Kayla followed up with a post that featured another picture of the pair that read, “Only God can judge me.”</p><p>While she didn’t tag her in the photo, some sleuthing reveals that Kayla’s rumored girlfriend is named <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">JayLa Brown</a>. Underneath Kayla’s post, her comment section was flooded with congratulations and criticisms alike.</p><p>“I knew it, I had a feeling this would happen.

Right? Wrong.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Amid the controversy, JayLa came forward to set the record straight about her and Kayla. “Me and Kayla are best friends guys, I’ve been knowing her for years,” she wrote in the comments.
