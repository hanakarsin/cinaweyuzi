Heck, Michael Douglass played a character in a film who attempted to buy some breakfast and went on a rampage because the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">item he purchased looked nothing like the one in the photo</a>. And while the fast food industry has continued to grow, and the stigma associated with these options from the movie Super Size Me has subsided, reports indicate that there's been a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">marked dip in quality over the years</a>.</p><p>Part of this growth can be attributed to the multitude of ways popular chains are implementing creative strategies to bring more people into their stores, and seasonal offerings are a good way of doing that. Take Starbucks' <a href=#>Pumpkin Spiced Latte, for instance</a>, which brings millions and millions of customers into its stores for the fall so folks can get themselves a taste of the beloved autumn beverage.</p><p>Dunkin' Donuts, aka "The Working Man's" coffee shop, also has its own fall offerings and pumpkin-flavored beverages, but it also has special fall-themed donuts. Its pumpkin-flavored cake donuts have been a staple of the chain for many years, but they're also selling Halloween-themed donuts for folks who want to get their spook on.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Dunkin Donuts</a></figure><p>As per a Dunkin' Donuts press release, the chain is now offering a Peanut Butter Cup iced macchiato, a Dunk-O-Lantern Donut, a Spider Specialty Donut, and a Blood Orange Refresher.</p><p>And a TikToker by the name of Danielle wanted to get herself one of these Dunk-O-Lantern donuts to chow down on, thinking that she was going to get a cute little offering to chow down on.</p><p>Dunkin' describes the treat as such: "The Dunk-o-Lantern is here! This festive treat features a classic pumpkin-shaped donut shell filled with vanilla-flavored butter cr√®me filling, topped with orange icing, and a classic Jack-o'-lantern grin."</p><p>However, when she showed off the item in a now-viral TikTok, she wasn't greeted with a dessert that many people would want to show off on their Instagram feeds.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@deee_2525 href=#>@deee_2525</a><p>@Dunkin' ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I just wanted a nice jack-o-lantern donut ü§£üò≠ <a title=dunkindonuts href=#>#dunkindonuts</a> <a title=halloween href=#>#halloween</a> <a title=fail href=#>#Fail</a> <a title=dunkinfail href=#>#dunkinfail</a> <a title=donut href=#>#donut</a> <a title=fyp href=#>#fyp</a> <a title=foryoupage href=#>#foryoupage</a> <a title=foodie href=#>#Foodie</a> <a title=jackolantern href=#>#jackolantern</a> <a title=wlw href=#>#wlw</a></p><a title="‚ô¨ original sound - Kneely_Knight" href=#>‚ô¨ original sound - Kneely_Knight</a> <span>Source: TikTok | @deee_2525</span></figure><p>The beginning of the video shows was the donut is supposed to look like and then when she finally reveals what it is, viewers are met with a face that looks more like the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Pumpkinhead monster</a> than a smiling jack-o-lantern.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @deee_2525</span></figure><p>It looks like whoever was designing the donut thought it would be a good idea to put their own spin on the design or maybe they ran out of chocolate syrup. Instead of a triangular shaped nose and a squiggly chocolate line for the mouth, two pumpkin candies were lodged into the icing to give the semblance of eyes.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @deee_2525</span></figure><p>The mouth looks like a shock of makeup that Heath Ledger's Joker would use to paint his face: it's a glob of chocolate syrup resembling a syrup-ey frown rather than a festive Halloween grin.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @deee_2525</span></figure><p>Danielle isn't the only person who has expressed their disappointment with a Dunk-O-Lantern donut they purchased from a DD location. Twitter user @foodeater98 tweeted out a picture of one that didn't have any attempts a face decoration at all.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>A Dunk-o-Lantern donut from <a href=#>@dunkindonuts</a>. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/2gESh7ofap</a></p>‚Äî My Food Journal (: (@foodeater98) <a href=#>October 19, 2022</a> <span>Source: Twitter | @foodeater98</span></figure><p>Others had a bit more luck at least receiving goods that seemed more in line with the offerings from the popular coffee franchise.
