So we are saying that some of them can be retraced.</p><p>“And this is particularly for areas that are not encroached upon as of now. The pastoralists know the routes, and on some of those routes, you will see the pieces of the monuments along them.”</p><p>Lai-Solarin added, “So for those that are not encroached upon and are not in conflict zones, we will go ahead to retrace and guide the pastoralists along them. We didn’t get to where we are today in one day and so we cannot expect that every pastoralist should suddenly start ranching now.</p><p>“Some would still have to move but let’s keep the movement as safe as possible and in areas that are not conflict zones. That is what I am saying. We are not going to retrace stock routes where there are infrastructures that are for the public good.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH13e5ByZqGdopnArrHNZpmuoJGntm6zzq%2BrZpqVnLavv4yrnJynppq%2FunnOn2SgqpGvtq%2BzjKumrqyVqHw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./bayo-lawal.html><span>←</span><span>Read All The Latest News About Bayo Lawal On Naija News</span></a>
