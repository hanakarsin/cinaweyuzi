But is this life hack illegal?</h2><p>TikTok users have watched @tripsti’s TikTok <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">video</a> more than 7 million times as of this writing. In the clip, T-Rip shows us a little-known loophole. The label on the bottle says: “Return the package for replacement or money back. 1-877-595-2267 or visit us online at Walmart.com."</p><p>Because the text is not very specific, T-Rip says it’s pretty much left up to interpretation. The label doesn’t say return if it’s damaged or tastes bad — it just says bring it back and you’ll get a replacement.</p>Article continues below advertisement<figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@tripsti7 href=#>@tripsti7</a><p>My little life hack I thought I'd share with y'all! <a title=freewater href=#>#freewater</a> <a title=walmart href=#>#walmart</a></p><a title="♬ original sound - T-Rip" href=#>♬ original sound - T-Rip</a></figure><p>For @tripsti7, that means saving all of his empty water bottles and the package they came in to take back up to Walmart for a fresh set.</p><p>But before you start stocking up on 36-packs, you should keep in mind that what you’re doing may or may not be illegal.</p>Article continues below advertisement<p>This isn’t the first time someone has taken to the internet with this hack.

The key is being nice. If they think you're just exploiting a loophole, they'll turn you away.”</p><p>Given that a pack of water from Walmart only costs a couple of dollars, it’s best you only use this life hack for a very rainy day.
