While the actor didn't confirm those specific details, he did indicate a couple of weeks after the rumors swirled among Psych fans that he had come down with "a wee touch of a stroke."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>My Dear tweet-erers,<br>As you may have heard, I have had a wee touch of a stroke. Thanks for all the ♥️ and well wishes.</p>— Timothy Omundson (@Omundson) <a href=#>May 19, 2017</a></figure><p>Though he was joking and downplaying the severity of his condition, Tim had a long uphill battle over the next two years. It also necessitated a big rewrite of the Psych: The Movie script and a reduction in the role of his beloved character, Carlton Lassiter. Though his recovery is not complete, Tim is feeling loads better and in August of this year it was announced he was among several new cast members joining This Is Us in Season 4. However, it wasn't until the most recent episode that we knew anything more about his role.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Welcome back my friend.

With Toby getting ripped at secret Crossfit sessions and Kate feeling unmoored with all the stress of a new baby with challenges, there's some cause for concern, especially since the flashes forward seem to signal Katoby is donezo in the future.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: NBC</span></figure><p>Though Kate and Gregory didn't get off to the best start, by the end of the episode they understood each other better and had become walking buddies. While that all seems harmless now, we know This Is Us well enough to spot a signature Dan Fogelman "we hated each other at first" meet-cute.</p><p>This Is Us airs Tuesdays at 9 p.m. ET on NBC</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqbauu9OhsGannaq7pb%2FOp2SsrKKkuKY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./andy-milonakis-html.html><span>←</span><span>Andy Milonakis - Age, Family, Bio</span></a>
