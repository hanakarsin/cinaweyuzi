For example, if you hear him purring, you can assume that he is content. But if he hisses at you, you can assume that he is ticked off. But what about all the other noises cats make?</p><p>TikTok creator @alecanewman shares what he believes some of these noises mean. "How to speak cat. Lesson 1. "Mah mah mah," he says, " which means food," in a video.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@alecanewman href=#>@alecanewman</a><p>I learned this from a Siamese 30 years ago, so it crosses generations and types. <a title=cattok href=#>#cattok</a></p><a title="♬ original sound - Alecanewman" href=#>♬ original sound - Alecanewman</a></figure><p>Basically, he is implying that if you hear a cat go "mah mah mah" really quickly, he or she wants food. In his caption, he writes: "I learned this from a Siamese 30 years ago, so it crosses generations and types." He demonstrates the noise and it quickly garners his cat's attention.</p><p>In a second video, @alecanewman claims that if you say "ma-ah," to your cat, it means "come here."</p><p>But as he explains, "This one is difficult because normally when you call a dog, they come. When you call a cat, you leave a message. But let's see if it works."</p><p>@alecanewman tries it out on his cat, who ignores his first attempt but starts walking toward him after the second attempt. Victory!</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@alecanewman href=#>@alecanewman</a><p>Replying to @Jason Farrand Also learned from a Siamese cat in the 90s. 10% of the time, this works great. <a title=cattok href=#>#cattok</a></p><a title="♬ original sound - Alecanewman" href=#>♬ original sound - Alecanewman</a></figure><p>In another video, he unpacks what he believes "Brrrrr-ah" means, claiming that it's a much more gentle way to say "come here," to your cat or to wake him up.</p><p>He tries it out on his napping cat, who rolls over immediately.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@alecanewman href=#>@alecanewman</a><p>Replying to @Aylin But if your cat is sleeping peacefully, let them nap a bit longer. <a title=cattok href=#>#cattok</a> <a title=howtospeakcat href=#>#howtospeakcat</a></p><a title="♬ original sound - Alecanewman" href=#>♬ original sound - Alecanewman</a></figure><p>In the comment section of @alecanewman's videos, users had mixed thoughts. A few folks claimed that their cats did not respond to the sounds he discussed.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: tiktok</span></figure><p>However, others loved that he was creating these videos and demanded more.</p><p>One user joked " bro's fluent in cat," to which @alecanewman replied: "Nah, just conversational." Another joked, "Giving all these cats a crisis their human learned how to talk suddenly."</p><p>And one more jokester kept the laughs coming by asking: "How do you say in cat “pay me rent!”</p><p>For more cat language videos, follow @alecanewman on TikTok.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnby4edOoZKyolZa4bq%2FArWStoZupvKx7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./koosung-jung-html.html><span>←</span><span>Koosung Jung - Age, Family, Bio</span></a>
