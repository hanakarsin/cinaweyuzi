He struggled against Barcelona defenders and only won one aerial duel. Barcelona’s weak point was the defense, and he could not emerge.”</p><p>On the contrary, Juventus legend, Alessandro Del Piero has hailed Victor Osimhen’s attitude in a season the retired footballer believes has been a difficult one for the reigning Italian champions.</p><p>“You may feel down, but his [Osimhen’s] qualities are unquestionable,” Del Piero said according to Napoli Magazine.</p><p>“In general, he is in a very negative season for Napoli, and therefore, he has not faced everything that has happened in this season with a smile, but his attitude has always been positive.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpkZH10e5BsZq2gopqybrXTmqOimZ5iuaazxKebrGWUnsCis9GenGannmLDqq%2FTqKlmp6OeuqmxzaxkqZ2im7yzucCnmp5lkZyuqrrSrWSbmaKYsq27zZpm</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-gave-leah-the-phone-the-wilds.html><span>←</span><span>The Person Who Gave Leah Her Phone in 'The Wilds' Season 2 Was a Double Agent</span></a>
