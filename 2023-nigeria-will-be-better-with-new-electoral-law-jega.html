We must ensure that this bill becomes law. It is very important that we have a legal framework, it will improve the integrity of the conduct of the election.</p><p>“The lawmakers think that if they opt for direct primaries they will free themselves from manipulation.</p><p>“We need to interrogate these things. If we must do direct primaries, we must do it well. Which political party in Nigeria today has a clear party register to conduct direct primaries? Let us not leave one problem and run into another one.</p><p>“If we proceed to do it (direct primaries) the way we are doing it, we will create more problems.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH1ye5BvZmtoYmh6r7XGnqmimV2stq24jJucZpqVqcGmvoywoK2gXaOyuHnEpZycrJ%2Bnrq15y5quZqKVnK5w</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./reactions-as-davido-allows-his-babymama-sophia-momodu-step-out-with-his-bentley-despite-not-being-romantically-linked.html><span>←</span><span>Reactions as Davido Allows His Babymama, Sophia Momodu Step Out With His Bentley Despite Not Being R</span></a>
