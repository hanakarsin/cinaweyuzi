And it’s not only about Abuja-Kaduna.</p><p>“Yes, Abuja-Kaduna belt was discussed specifically, but we appreciate the fact that we are in the season of festivity. So, all agencies are committed to providing security for Nigeria and the maintenance of law and order.</p><p>“They have been ordered to improve their activities, intensify surveillance and minimise, if not eliminate, any threat to law and order anywhere in Nigeria.”</p><p>Aregbesola noted that the Police is the lead agency on internal security. “Therefore, maintenance of Law and Order will start with the police and then extend to all the other security agencies.”</p><p>The minister while emphasizing security challenges as the Yuletide period draws near, said Nigerians should expect to see an improved response to all those challenging the sovereignty of Nigeria in whatever form.</p><p>Aregbesola said: “The council today took a firm decision on what to be done and I can assure Nigerians that with the charge from the President and the commander in chief of the Armed Forces today, there will be an improved response to all forms of criminality in any part of Nigeria,</p><p>“The armed forces of Nigeria and other security agencies, intelligence organisations, must not rest on their oars, as we are making progress in our effort to eliminate insurgency, banditry, kidnapping for ransom, and all the other criminalities because Nigerians deserve to live in peace,” he affirmed.</p><p>He added, “The President received briefs from Service Chiefs and the security agencies and intelligence organisations on the state of security nationwide.</p><p>“While appreciating the successes and gains made by all the security agencies from the armed forces of Nigeria to the police and other intelligence organisations, as well as other security agencies, he believes that more must still and should still be done.”</p><p>Speaking further about the success of the Anambra election, the Minister said: “The President was particularly happy about the free and fair governorship election in Anambra. And he was quite happy that the combination of INEC and the security agencies, from the military to the police and all the other agencies made that possible with the support of the people of Anambra and the government of Anambra. And we all saw the outcome”.</p><p>He said with the successes recorded, there is no doubt as to the regime’s commitment to promoting democracy and ensuring that 2023 is not threatened.</p><p>Speaking further, the minister said that the council was briefed about the election of a Nigerian, AIG Garba Umaru, who emerged out of four other candidates, as the vice president of Interpol for Africa.</p><p>He said “this means that a Nigerian today represents the 54 African nations at the Interpol level.</p><p>“The election took place today, a couple of hours ago.
