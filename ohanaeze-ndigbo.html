Nigeria currently needs politicians with spread of acceptance and without bias of religion and ethnicity.</p><p>“Umahi fits into this position. When some politicians here were pursuing selfish interests, Umahi, who is currently the Senator-elect for Ebonyi South Senatorial zone, took his people into the mainstream of Nigerian politics, as if he saw tomorrow. He has made friends across the divide; he has demonstrated tolerance for all sections and strata; so, he is the one the cap fits.</p><p>“For the interest of unity, gains of Umahi’s proven commitment to one Nigeria, infrastructure and human development, Igbo interest, as well as the need to galvanise support for our long-sought chance to have one of us stride to the presidency in the near future, we seek the support of all to enthrone Umahi as the next Senate President.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGiwqKiZmHywtMCnmJ6ylWK7pbXGm6Zo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./1942-html.html><span>←</span><span>Celebrities Born in 1942 | Famous Birthdays</span></a>
