That's not even the worst of it. She was also gifted condiment packets from various fast-food restaurants, including Wendy's and <a href=#>Chick-fil-A</a>.</p><p>Did he forget about the exchange and panic at the last minute? We are so confused.</p><p>But remember, this was a voluntary gift exchange, so as one commenter noted, the contents of the bag "seem spiteful and intentional."</p><p>And that's not even the worst part of the entire not-so-merry message. As the creator later shared, the gifter and co-worker later asked for the bag back!</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@thatasianbihhh href=#>@thatasianbihhh</a><p>I forgot to add, then he ASKED FOR THE BAG BACK! 🙄 I cannot make this shit up. 🤦🏻‍♀️ <a title=secretsanta href=#>#secretsanta</a> <a title=secretsantagift href=#>#secretsantagift</a> <a title=secretsantafail href=#>#secretsantafail</a> <a title=fyp href=#>#fyp</a> <a title=foryou href=#>#foryou</a> <a title=christmas2023 href=#>#christmas2023</a> <a title=wtf href=#>#wtf</a> <a title=grinchmas href=#>#grinchmas</a> <a title=explorepage href=#>#explorepage</a> <a title=iwonthischallenge href=#>#iwonthischallenge</a> <a title=blowthisshitup href=#>#blowthisshitup</a></p><a title="♬ original sound - Amanda Panda" href=#>♬ original sound - Amanda Panda</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Commenters feel this is so much more than a Secret Santa fail.</h2><p>Beyond this "gift" being downright wrong according to commenters, it's a reason for the creator to either file a complaint with human resources or <a href=#>full out quit her job</a> "on the spot."</p><p>Yes, to TikTok, it's that serious.</p><p>One commenter even said that the half-eaten crackers and other items constitute micro-aggression. Someone else blasted the co-worker as having perpetrated a <a href=#>hate crime</a> against the creator. We aren't even sure if they were joking! People are seriously disturbed by the situation.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>The rice is HR alone.</p>— 𝐇𝐞𝐧𝐫𝐲 𝐏𝐡𝐢𝐥𝐲𝐚𝐰 (@justxhenry) <a href=#>December 25, 2023</a></figure><p>"Nah I’d quit on the spot that’s so disrespectful," a Twitter user <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">reacted</a> upon seeing the Secret Santa gift that has blown up the internet.</p><p>Just a few were on hand to defend the gifter, with one person <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">sharing</a>, "I’m Asian… so when someone does this to you, as an Asian, you definitely deserved it!"</p><p>But another prevailing thought about the seemingly rude, not to mention useless gift, is that if those <a href=#>lottery tickets</a> are winners, then at least the new owner of sauce packets and microwavable rice — unless he took those back, too — had the very last laugh.</p><p>And, to be fair, no one could beat this employee when it came to having ever received a worse Secret Santa gift. So, she also wins that contest as well.</p><p>In the end, I'm left wondering if the gifter got exactly what he wanted, which is to get a rise out of his co-worker. He even succeeded in irritating thousands of TikTok and Twitter users.</p><p>Here's hoping Santa brought this creator a few presents she wanted for Christmas!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfl66lecKorqiqm5q%2Fbr%2FEnKmerF2orq%2FAwGaeop6k</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./411741-video-ya-june-ruto-na-mumewe-wakinyunyiziwa-pesa-yaibuka-html.html><span>←</span><span>Video ya June Ruto na Mumewe Wakinyunyiziwa Pesa Yaibuka</span></a>
