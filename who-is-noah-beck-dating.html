The two confirmed their romance in October 2020 after Noah told AwesomenessTV: "I am dating Dixie D'Amelio. Dixie's amazing, she's an awesome girl! It's been really fun and I'm excited for the future with her."</p><p>While the couple continued to not shy away from PDA-filled TikTok videos and Instagram pictures, the public eye seemingly put a strain on their relationship.</p><p>"People saying, 'I won't believe in love if they don't last' — that's a lot of pressure coming from people," Dixie told cameras in Season 1 of the family's reality series, <a href=#>The D'Amelio Show</a>. "Because we're doing the best we can to just be our happiest selves in our relationship, and now we feel like people rely on our relationship."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Noah Beck (@noahbeck)</a></p></figure><p>In 2022, fans began to notice that two were not posting as frequently together, prompting breakup rumors to circulate. However, Noah explained to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">E! News</a> that the pair have decided to keep their relationship more private.</p><p style=text-align:start>"I've been telling a lot of people we're kind of keeping things offline. And since we've been doing so, it's been good. It's been kind of like a weight off the shoulder in a way," he said. "We kind of just enjoy time together rather than, like, seeming like we do it for our fans, in a sense. We're doing it for each other and that's what it's all about."</p><p>Though reports seemed to suggest that the couple may have gone their separate ways, Noah and Dixie denied the rumors. However, in Season 2 of Hulu's The D'Amelio Show, Dixie tells her parents that the pair have decided to call it quits on their relationship.</p><p>"Noah — I don't know what's going on with that," she says. "I feel like I'm very stressed out about the whole situation. We're not really talking right now. We've come to that conclusion that we just shouldn't talk for a little bit, but we're broken up."</p><p>While the status of their romance changed once filming wrapped on Season 2, Noah's publicist confirmed to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The New York Times</a> in November 2022 that the pair had officially cut ties.</p><p>"We can confirm that the pair are no longer together but remain close friends," she stated. Following their split, it seems the couple is hyperfocused on their individual careers — Dixie is continuing to pursue music while Noah is working on his acting career.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWwecisZKenkZ16o7HCpGSdmaSeu6g%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./1247556-how-read-a-ruler-a-tape-measure-a-guide-html.html><span>←</span><span>How to read a ruler or a tape measure: a guide</span></a>
