Literally moments after her release in December 2023, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">PEOPLE</a> already had an interview up. She told the outlet she was "ready for freedom." And while many believed she had earned the right to do almost anything, as she was a victim of severe trauma at the hands of her mother, some folks felt uncomfortable.</p><p>Blanchard immediately became a celebrity whose social media numbers were in the millions. Should a murderer be an influencer? Only time will tell. She also <a href=#>left prison a married woman</a>, but that didn't last very long. As of the time of this writing, Blanchard has moved on with a new man who is actually an old man (though not literally). Before we confuse you further, let's take a gander at Gypsy Rose Blanchard's relationship timeline.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Gypsy Rose Blanchard's relationship timeline is all over the place.</h2><p>It's not a stretch to say that Blanchard's life changed when she met her first boyfriend, <a href=#>Nicholas Godejohn</a>. They met on ChristianDatingForFree.com in October 2012, per the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Springfield News-Leader</a>. The conversations quickly turned to Blanchard's home life and her overbearing, abusive mother, who had no idea they were secretly dating. Soon they were plotting to kill Dee Dee Blanchard in order to be together. Three years later in June 2015, Godejohn stabbed Dee Dee to death while Blanchard hid in the bathroom.</p><p>In 2018, Ken Urker decided to participate in a prison pen-pal program, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Cut</a>. In April 2019, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">E News</a> reported that Blanchard and Urker were engaged. The couple decided to wait until she was released from prison so they could go ring shopping together and plan a proper wedding, but that day never came. Blanchard and Urker took a break in August 2019 but when they got back together, things had just "fizzled out," via <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">E News</a>.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span><p>Nicholas Godejohn</p></figure><p>The relationship did not last as Godejohn and Blanchard were convicted of first-degree murder and second-degree murder, respectively. Godejohn was sentenced to life but according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bustle</a>, is in the process of appealing his conviction. The two have no communicated since their arrest. A few years after she was convicted, Blanchard was seeing someone else.</p><p>Once again, letter writing rescued Blanchard from a life of singledom when she received correspondence from Ryan Anderson. The middle school special education teacher told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">PEOPLE</a> that he decided to write Blanchard a letter after a coworker revealed he was planning to send on to Tiger King's Joe Exotic. Anderson had already seen the 2017 HBO documentary, Mommy Dead and Dearest, which prompted him to share how much her story meant to him. Blanchard in turn really liked that like her, he was from Louisiana.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Gypsy-Rose Blanchard (@gypsy.rose.blanchard.insta)</a></p></figure><p>They married in July 2022 and 17 months later, she was out of prison. Three months after that in March 2024, Blanchard announced on her private Faceebook page that she and Anderson were separating, reported <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">CBS News</a>. Blanchard revealed she had moved back in with family and needed time to "let myself find ... who I am." However, eagle-eyed fans suspected an old flame had been reignited, and they weren't wrong.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">When did Gypsy Rose get with Ken?</h2><p>Mere weeks after announcing her divorce, Blanchard was spotted hanging out with her ex-fiancé and things looked more than friendly. She and Urker got matching tattoos and were seen holding hands. She confirmed their relationship to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TMZ </a>in April 2024 after the outlet reported the two of them kissing at Jazzfest in New Orleans. "After reconnecting earlier this month, we realized that our love for each other is simply undeniable, and life is too short to not take a chance," she told TMZ.</p><p>Things have moved pretty quickly for Blanchard who announced she was pregnant on July 9, 2024. <a href=#>Distractify previously reported</a> that she is expected to give birth in January 2025. So far she described the pregnancy as relatively easy, with some fatigue and strange cravings. What she is most looking forward to is giving her child the kind of life she and Urker never had growing up.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnMaxv9hmqairlWKvra3NnJ%2BaqpRiv6a4wK2gqKajnbaxeceiqq2noq4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./apc-govs-forum-boss-slams-ngige-ehanire-over-doctors-strike.html><span>←</span><span>APC Govs' Forum DG Slams Ngige, Ehanire Over Doctors' Strike</span></a>
