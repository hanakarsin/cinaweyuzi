He will deal with that, of course, and I hope today will already be better, but yesterday everyone could see he still has the final in his mind.”</p><p>He added that “When you lose a final, which we are obviously the best example for, it is really, really hard, but if you use it for the next big game or next big tournament then it can at least still be helpful, even if it was really hard.”</p><p>Salah is, however, in contention to feature against Leicester on Thursday as Liverpool aim to keep the pressure on Manchester City at the top of the table.</p><p>Klopp though in his expression does not believe Salah needs any more motivation to succeed.</p><p>The Reds coach said: “Greater determination than Mo already had? I am not sure that is human.</p><p>“Yes, that all helps in the long-term, but I don’t think there is a lot of space for more determination in Mo’s mind,” Klopp added.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH1ze49yZqWhppq%2FsbvOpWSsmZyWtW6%2F06KjpWWZo3qxrcinZJqepJq%2Fbq3FnKanZWJlf3J506umqaCpYrmwv9Jmq6hlnZa7pnnSnqWen5Gheqy4zqmnaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kiersey-clemons-html.html><span>←</span><span>Kiersey Clemons - Age, Family, Bio</span></a>
