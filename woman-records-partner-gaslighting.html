As she was walking around in their place, the man in question appeared to toss some water at her. When she asked him why he would do that, he went into full denial mode, calling her crazy in the process ‚Äî all in an attempt to gaslight her or her viewers into thinking that she was the one who was mistreating him.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@t.h.e.storm href=#>@t.h.e.storm</a><p>I know ill never win ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è <a title=gaslighting href=#>#gaslighting</a> <a title=narcissistic href=#>#narcissistic</a></p><a title="‚ô¨ original sound - The Storm" href=#>‚ô¨ original sound - The Storm</a></figure><p>"Why would you do that? Why would you do that?" the TikToker says in the clip, pointing to an open plastic bottle of water and then what looks like a plastic folder slip. She seems to be questioning her now-ex, who is seated at the counter, about why he would pour the water on the table.</p><p>He argues back at her that she's the one who spilled the water. "I didn't do any of that," he replies.</p><p>"Really?"</p><p>"What are you talking about?" he says, sounding like <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tim Robinson in the I Think You Should Leave fully loaded nachos sketch</a>.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @t.h.e.storm</span></figure><p>The man continues: "You threw water on me and then you're recording me?" he shouts while gesturing with his hand toward her. "Are you serious, bro?" he says while she attempts to speak back to him.</p><p>"You're so f----- psychotic," he tells her. "You do anything for views, do you not?"</p><p>The man continues to try and verbally vie for the moral high ground. "Oh my God," he says, shaking his head as he places his hands inside of his pockets. "You need, you need to be hospitalized," he goes on to say as she re-adjusts the camera, centering it back on the man.</p><p>It appears at this point in the video she wants to continue to record him to hear what he has to say. He looks at her while continuing to act like he did nothing wrong. He looks back down at the table, then picks up his phone and begins to interact with it.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @t.h.e.storm</span></figure><p>The camera angle then switches to show him seated at the counter; he drinks water from a bottle, and then flicks it in front of him. The text overlay reads: "Because I'll always be the bad guy. If I react I'm the bad guy. If I run I'm the bad guy. If I fight back I'm the bad guy."</p><p>She can be heard asking him if he threw water at her. She mentions the word "ruining" to which the man replies, from what it sounds like, that he isn't doing anything wrong.</p><p>"Are you joking?" OP can be heard saying in the second angle as she quickly enters and leaves the frame.</p><p>"I haven't done anything," the man tells her as she takes out her phone. "Go on, record me," he says, and it's at this point in the video he begins taking a verbal offensive, either not knowing or forgetting that there's a second angle placed on him at all times.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>In a follow-up video she gave even further context on the situation, stating that she had kicked him out of her place "a million times" and that he kept coming back, which is why she decided to place a Ring security camera in their Christmas tree.</p><p>She didn't intend on recording him, but the motion sensing camera caught a snippet of their altercation during their exchange.</p><p>The Storm added that despite installing multiple cameras and locks to keep him out of her house, he would always manage to find a way back into her home.</p><p>To top it all off, she says that she caught her former partner "hiding drugs" and alcohol in the home, and that everyone she would air her relationship grievances to, for the most part, would take his side.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@t.h.e.storm href=#>@t.h.e.storm</a><p>Replying to @Emaley Nurse. üá¨üáæüá∫üá∏üíú <a title=greenscreen href=#>#greenscreen</a></p><a title="‚ô¨ original sound - The Storm" href=#>‚ô¨ original sound - The Storm</a></figure><p>"Everybody always called me crazy ... always told me I was the enabler," she recalled, saying that in their eyes, it was somehow her fault he was relapsing into cyclical patterns of substance abuse.</p><p>Numerous commenters who replied to her videos sympathized with her plight, with several individuals writing she should use the footage as part of her legal defense against her ex.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLyurc1mqZ6bn6extHnPmqmtppWneqit0qWgoKCknruo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./virgo-martinez-html.html><span>‚Üê</span><span>Virgo Martnez - Age, Family, Bio</span></a>
