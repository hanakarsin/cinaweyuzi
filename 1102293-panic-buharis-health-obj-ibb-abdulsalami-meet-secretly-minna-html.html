Certain Nigerian leaders, having been blindfolded by corruption, assume the possibility of using money in manipulating the national security agencies to intimidate, suppress and hold down certain ethnic nationalities or playing one ethnic nationality against the other with a view to undermining the constitution and perversely upturning the rule of law.</i></p><p class=align-left><i>“To avoid the ugly consequences of letting President Buhari’s ailments throw Nigeria into confusion, I am urging all Nigerians to begin to pray for his divine healing and perfect recovery”.</i></p><p class=align-left>Akande warned those hoping to harvest political gains out of the health of the president to desist, adding that they are making a big mistake.</p><p class=align-left>He continued: <i>“This is not Nigeria of 1993. We are in a new national and global era of constitutionalism and order. We hope Nigerians have enough patience to learn from history. My greatest fear, however, is that the country should not be allowed to slide into anarchy and disorder of a monumental proportion.</i></p><p class=align-left><i>“The health of the leader is intricately intertwined with the health of the nation. It is more so in a delicately fragile union of nations called Nigeria”.</i></p><p class=align-left>Expressing his feeling about the president’s health, Akande said, <i>“I did not see President Buhari at the wedding of his grand son in Kaduna last Saturday. I was sad and I wept. When last we met at the wedding of his daughter in Abuja last December, I complained to him that I was not happy about his stressful looks.</i></p><p class=align-left><i>“His reply connoted some allusions to circumstances where an honest man fighting corruption is surrounded mostly by unpatriotic greedy ruling class. He felt painfully frustrated. He assured me he would soon be going on vacation. I then knew that corruption has effectively been fighting back. And I prayed for Nigeria.</i></p><p class=align-left><i>“That was why Ashiwaju Bola Tinubu and I rushed to meet him in London in February this year when he was sick and could not return as scheduled from his vacation. The rest is history but we must appreciate that his poor health is already taking a toll on the health of Nigeria as a polity”.</i></p><p></p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkfnJ8kWtwbGWglruqr4ybrKGZop7AbrTEmqOtoF2kr6t5yJuZZpmSmcKtv8ClmKahXaKypsCMrJycqpWpubp5zKKlp5lencGuuA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./64975-html.html><span>←</span><span>Nollywood Actress, Cossy Orjiakor Shares New Photos</span></a>
