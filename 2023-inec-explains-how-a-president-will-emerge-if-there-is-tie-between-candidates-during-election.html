Not all the 18 registered political parties sponsoring candidates will participate in this second election.”</p><h2>Smart Card Readers, BVAS Will Be Deployed</h2><p>Speaking on other modalities to ensure the success of the 2023 polls, Okoye said technology will be deployed. Particularly, he noted that the commission will deploy the Smart Card Readers/Bimodal Voter Accreditation System (BVAS).</p><p>According to him, “It must be appreciated from the outset that Smart Card Reader Machine or simply Card Reader (SCRM for short), is an innovation in our Electoral Process. It was not known, or rather, it was never put into practice before in our political development.</p><p>“From my general reading and my comprehension of the literature surrounding the Smart Card Reader Machine, it appears to me and, put in a concise form, that the Smart Card Reader Machine is a technological device set up to authenticate and verify, on election day a permanent voter’s card (PVC) issued by INEC.</p><p>“Smart Card Reader Machine is designed to read information contained in the embedded chip of the Permanent Voter’s Card (PVC) issued by INEC to verify the authenticity of the PVC and also carry out a verification of the intending voter by matching the biometrics contained from the voter on the spot with the ones stored on the PVC.</p><p>“INEC’s motive, which became public in introducing the technologically-based device, barring any technical mishap, breakdown or malfunction, was to ensure a credible, transparent, free and fair election for the country.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH16e5FwZmtoYmh6qrrEnGSesKChrqq60mafqK9dlnqxvsSsoJ2dnql6uLXLpWSepZWntKZ5yJ9kraCVp7JutdJmq6KdXZeytcPEnqVmm5GjsaqwwK2crGWUqr%2BqusZmnKWdk6m2sLqO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./vergil-ortiz-jr-html.html><span>←</span><span>Vergil Ortiz Jr. - Age, Family, Bio</span></a>
