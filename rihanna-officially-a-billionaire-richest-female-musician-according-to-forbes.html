The make-up line relies on inclusiveness by offering a foundation available in 50 shades, making it easier for women and men of colour to find a product suited to their skin tone.</p><p></p><p>The products very quickly know a worldwide craze and eventually overtake other lines of cosmetics created by other celebrities, such as Kylie Cosmetics by Kylie Jenner.&nbsp;According to&nbsp;Forbes, the company is now valued at $ 2.8 billion (€ 2.35 billion) of which 50% is owned by Rihanna.</p><p>La Barbadienne does not stop there and in 2018 launches Savage x Fenty, a line of lingerie that operates on the same principle of inclusiveness by offering underwear for each body type.&nbsp;A company also supported by LVMH and that Forbes estimates at $ 270 million.&nbsp;The singer owns 30% of the shares, the rest belonging to the French luxury group.</p><p>But all is not perfect in this&nbsp;success story. Her ready-to-wear brand Fenty, deemed too expensive and impacted by the health crisis, ended up disappearing.</p><p>With a fortune estimated at 1.7 billion dollars, Rihanna overtakes another artist turned businessman: Kanye West. With a wealth valued at $1.3 billion, the rapper and his shoe and clothing brand Yeezy are behind the singer of the famous&nbsp;Umbrella&nbsp;.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH15e49tZquhmJa7r62MqJ2foZOerq242GaYZpqZobmqu82aoKudXae2pLTErKtmnpWirq2xjKasrKGTnq6vecCcmqiqlJ67qHnTqGSfp6KXsrR7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./376185-pigo-kwa-barcelona-baada-ya-messi-kuwatumia-ujumbe-wa-kutaka-kuondoka-klabuni-html.html><span>←</span><span>Pigo kwa Barcelona baada ya Messi kuwatumia ujumbe wa kutaka kuondoka klabuni</span></a>
