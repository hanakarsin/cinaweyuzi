The party defeated the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in <a href=#>the 2015 general elections</a> and formed the majority in the two chambers of the National Assembly, so it becomes clear that the APC would produce the next Senate president and the Speaker of the House of Representatives.</p><p>2. The first sign of the crisis appeared after the chieftains of the party failed to zone the two major assembly offices to any of the six geo political zones.&nbsp;The APC called a <a href=#>“retreat” for all the senators and reps -elects</a> at Ibeto Hotel Abuja two weeks ago. The retreat had a success in having some people who had earlier signified their bid to vie for the two offices to step down, but it failed to come out with a single candidate for the office of the Senate president and the Speaker.</p><p><strong>READ ALSO:&nbsp;</strong><a href=#>Buhari Shuns APC Legislators’ Peace Meeting</a></p><p>3. Briefly after the retreat, two main groups in both chambers of the National Assembly emerged. The first group called themselves the “<a href=#>Senate Like Minds</a>” and they support Bukola Saraki. The second group “The Senate Unity Forum” endorsed Senator Lawan.</p><p>4. There were speculations that the national leader of the APC and a former governor of Lagos state, Bola Tinubu, was promoting Lawan’s candidature.&nbsp;President Muhammadu Buhari reportedly also disclosed his preference for Lawan during a meeting he had with the National Working Committee of the party.</p><p>5. The party had held a mock election for the principal officers of the National Assembly in a bid to ensure that it did not go into the election with a divided house.&nbsp;Senators Ahmed Lawan from Yobe and George Akume from Benue state were nominated to run as the APC’s candidates for the office of Senate President and Deputy Senate President correspondingly.&nbsp;Following serious disagreements over the emergence of the new leadership of the National Assembly, <a href=#>Bukola Saraki and Yakubu Dogara</a> allegedly plot revenge.</p><p>6. President Muhammadu Buhari, who has returned from G7 summit, has called for an emergency meeting of all federal lawmakers eleceted on the platform of the APC to solve the crisis.&nbsp;The reports emerge that APC <a href=#>postpones the inauguration</a> of the 8 National Assembly.&nbsp;However the swearing-in commenced and Bukola <a href=#>Saraki emerges as the new Senate president</a>.&nbsp;Ali Ndume (APC) and Ekweremadu (PDP) are currently battling for the post of the deputy Senate president.</p><p>7.&nbsp;Senate President&nbsp;Bukola Saraki was elected when most APC senators were waitintg for the arrival of President Buhari.&nbsp;57 senators were present at today's meeting at the National Assembly.</p><p><strong>READ ALSO:&nbsp;</strong><a href=#>How Ex-governors Plot Revolt Against Buhari</a></p><p>8.&nbsp;Yakubu Dogara who also lost the mock APC election and supposedly plotted to go ahead his party, <a href=#>emerges the leader of House of Representatives.</a></p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkgXaCj3JtZq%2BYrnq1tMRmq6itl52ytMCMnKmiq5moeqq6jJqnnKtdnba0wM6rsGabkaN6qa3PqZynZpipuq0%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-will-conrad-end-up-with-the-resident.html><span>←</span><span>Who Will Conrad End Up With on 'The Resident'?
