Our position in the 9th House of Representatives is that everyone must have equal opportunities to participate in governance and the democratic process.</p><p>“Our young people must have a seat at the high table and we must create the enabling environment for them to be in leadership such that a young man with bold ideas can come out to vie for any position, be it legislator, governor or any other office. That can only be achieved through direct primaries, which will give a fair chance to the youth of this country to be involved in governance.”</p><p>Gbajabiamila called for huge investment in youth education, particularly technology, which the speaker said had transformed the world from what it used to be into a global village, delivering services and innovations at an unprecedented speed.</p><p>He added, “Technology has changed our world. We no longer exist in communal or national silos but as part of a broad fabric of humanity in a global village where opportunities and challenges abound. In this new world where a child with a computer and internet connection in Lagos can compete for jobs in Texas or Bombay, our job as leaders is to ensure that every Nigerian child is educated and empowered to compete in and succeed in this global marketplace of ideas and talent.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH5ye5FpZrCgqWK2bq%2FHmqSpoZ%2BjsqV5xKWcnKyfp66tecGio6VllqS%2FbsDHnmSuq5VivKd5w6KpnpukYr2ztcyaqaKdo2K0o63JmpmimZ2euaJ7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./mom-only-gives-small-gifts-santa.html><span>←</span><span>Mom Says Santa Only Gives Her Kids Small Gifts on Christmas</span></a>
