This dry spell for the show is the perfect opportunity to take a trip down memory lane and relive some of the best (and worst) seasons of the franchise — and with 24 seasons, there’s a lot to pick from.</p><p>Which is why we’ve taken the time to compile some of the <a href=#>worst bachelors ever.</a></p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">1. Brad Womack had two chances at love.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: ABC</span></figure><p>Brad has gotten a lot of flack over the years for having two whole seasons dedicated to his search for love, only to not pick anyone, but he mostly deserves his title as one of the worst Bachelors ever for his unceremonious dumping of his two finalists before the Final Rose Ceremony.</p><p>While he gave it another chance on Season 15, he and his then-fiancé called off their engagement shortly after the season ended.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">2. Juan Pablo Galavis managed to make all of his contestants mad.</h2><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-fyFmx rJYJh"></figure><p>Listen, it’s one thing to be particular about who you date, but if you’re on a reality show about finding the love of your life, making all of the contestants mad at you is not a good look. Both DeAnna Pappas and Clare Crawley had individual blow-ups at the bachelor during his season, which he infamously responded to them with a repeated, “It’s OK.” No, Juan Pablo, it was not OK.</p><p>Add to that the homophobic comments he made after the show, and it’s impossible to leave him off this list.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">3. Jason Mesnick dumped Melissa on live TV.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: ABC</span></figure><p>Don’t get us wrong, we’re very happy that things worked out for Jason and Molly, but you really can’t overlook the fact that Jason decided to blindside his original finalist, Melissa, by breaking off their engagement on-screen.&nbsp;</p><p>Jason also had a weird, faux nice-guy vibe about him, which became especially apparent when he talked about the other contestants ahead of the Women Tell All special.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">4. Peter Weber waffled the whole season.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: ABC</span></figure><p>Let’s not forget the most recent Bachelor, who is arguably one of the most deserving of the title. Clearly, Peter took a leaf out of Jason’s book, dumping Hannah Ann for runner-up Madison — in fact, people have frequently compared Hannah Ann and Melissa’s breakup speeches. But at least Peter broke up with Hannah Ann before the After the Final Rose ceremony, giving her an opportunity to compose herself before addressing their breakup on television.</p><p>But not only did Peter get into a live fight with his mother over his relationship with Madison, but the pair announced their split mere days later, and he’s now dating Kelley Flanagan, who placed fifth on his season.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLyzv9NmmZqbmJq5sL6Mnq2eqg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ohanaeze-ndigbo.html><span>←</span><span>Ohanaeze Ndigbo Backs South-east Governor For Senate President</span></a>
