That was the most frustrating and dark time in my life but fortunately, I had an epiphany and that is when I started doing my research as to what funding is available for me to pursue my academic career and also what I actually wanted to study. Having the whole year to find myself, I applied at UJ and also got granted funding from NSFAS. <a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/45b973f16861ac28.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Musuho Wangia Natecho; Woman Who Rose from House Help to Banker</span></p></a>I then started varsity in 2012 doing an extended BA Humanities course which would take 4 years to complete. During this time I was studying modules such as Historical Studies, Development Studies, Politics, Public Management and Governance etc. Fast forward to 2021, I received my Master's and have been granted exclusive membership to the Golden Key International Honour Society for my academic achievements."<h2>Reactions</h2><p class=align-left>@Khensani Malungani said:</p>“Yah ne in 4 years I'll be proudly writing my journey...
