And with the onset of season 6 viewers are asking a familiar question: <a href=#>what year does it take place</a>?</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What year does 'Grantchester' series 6 take place?</h2><p>If you aren't familiar with the period piece crime drama, it has a pretty wonderful premise, an Anglican Vicar (priest) works with Scots guards and a Detective up-to-his-gills in casework to form a crime fighting alliance that's truly a joy to watch.</p><p>Grantchester paints a less than idyllic view of the United Kingdom, specifically an idyllic village/civil parish and the crimes that take place there.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: YouTube | @Masterpiece PBS</span></figure><p>The first series of episodes took place in the early 1950s, and Series 6 begins in the United Kingdom in 1958.</p><p>There's heaps of nostalgia associated with this time period and more often than not these days are almost looked at through a rose-tinted lens of innocence and quaintness.</p><p>Sure, there are films and TV shows in recent years that have shown the "darker" side of the 1950s and '60s: The Devil All the Time, 11.22.63, and Them are all prime examples.</p><p>Grantchester is similar in that regard, and like the aforementioned content, the series doubles down on staying true to period appropriate attire, creating a visually stunning vibe that easily draws you into the era.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>üö®Exciting news alertüö® <a href=#>#Grantchester</a> will return on <a href=#>@ITV</a> for a new eight-part series on Friday 3rd September at 9pm! <a href=#>@KudosTV</a> <a href=#>@tombrittney</a> <a href=#>#RobsonGreen</a> <a href=#>@kaceyainsworth</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/iWzR1aFdAB</a></p>‚Äî Grantchester (@GrantchesterUK) <a href=#>August 18, 2021</a> <span>Source: Twitter | @GrantchesterUK</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Is Grantchester a real town?</h2><p>If you've ever watched the show and wondered if they didn't pull a Parks & Rec and only create a fictional place that totally sounds like it could be the real deal, then fret not: the Grantchester series is 100% based on an actual Cambridgeshire Village.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Friday night is <a href=#>#Grantchester</a> night!

And while that doesn't seem like very long ago, same-sex acts weren't legal nationwide in the United States until 2003. 12 years later, same sex marriage would become legal nationwide. In the UK, that law was unanimously passed in 2013, meaning regardless of your sexual orientation, you could get married.</p><p>Still a long ways off for the plot of Grantchester, but in the latest season, the "groundwork conversations" so to speak where individuals challenged "traditional" modes of thinking are touched upon.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Happy grantchester day 9pm tonight <a href=#>@ITV</a> with the awesome <a href=#>@shaundooley</a> who I‚Äôve soft focussed the hell out of ü§£No wonder I‚Äôm not behind the lens I‚Äôll leave that to the talented hands of <a href=#>@JermainJulien</a> written by <a href=#>@TolulaDee</a> <a href=#>@masterpiecepbs</a> <a href=#>@Emlyjkl</a> <a href=#>@DaisyCoulam</a> <a href=#>@richardcookson</a> ‚ù§Ô∏è <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/ylhNPkn4EO</a></p>‚Äî Kacey Ainsworth üíô (@kaceyainsworth) <a href=#>October 8, 2021</a> <span>Source: Twitter | @kaceyainsworth</span></figure><p>Grantchester airs on Sundays on PBS at 9 PM EST, and on ITV in the UK at 9 PM Big Ben time.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIyynJqqXZm8pr%2BMoKmapqSYtaa%2F056pZqyRoLJuvMuamp4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tiktok-stair-challenge.html><span>‚Üê</span><span>What Is TikToks Stair Challenge?
