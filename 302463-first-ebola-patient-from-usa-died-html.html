We appreciate the dedicated service of the emergency and medical personnel who worked diligently to care for him. On behalf of the city of Dallas, I extend our deepest sympathies to the family and friends of Mr. Duncan. I remain confident in the abilities of our health care professionals and the medical advances here in the U.S. and reassure you we will stop the Ebola virus in its tracts from spreading into our community. I want to reinforce to the public, that this was an isolated incident of the Ebola virus; contracted by the individual while residing in another country. This is sad news for all involved. We will continue to work in partnership with Dallas County to do everything possible to protect our public health and all of the City of Dallas."</i></p><p>Duncan has been struggling with the disease for more than a week after he was diagnosed with Ebola on September 30.</p><p><strong>READ ALSO</strong>:&nbsp;<a href=#>US Denies Ebola Tests For Nigerians</a></p><p>He probably contracted the virus in Liberia.
