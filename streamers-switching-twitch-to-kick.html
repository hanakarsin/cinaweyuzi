On Twitch, that number is just shy of 6.5 million.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">xQc signed a non-exclusivity deal with Kick.</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>xQc earned a staggering $100 million for signing a non-exclusivity deal. That means you’ll find the streamer on both Twitch and Kick, depending on the day. His follower count is already a sizable 510,000. But when compared to the nearly 12 million followers on Twitch, it’s clear that Kick still has some catching up to do.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Adin Ross is a controverial Kick streamer.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Adin signed with Kick as a streamer, but is also an investor.
