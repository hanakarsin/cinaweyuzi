For formal events and settings, Nigerian women wear plain coloured trousers or those with muted patterns or prints.</p><p class=align-left>Like other outfit types, Ankara makes up a significant portion of women's trousers in Nigeria. One can choose from three-quarter length trousers, ankle-length, or something in between. Nigerian Ankara is one of the most versatile materials in terms of trouser design and look. You can choose to have tight-fitting trousers, loose ones, or have them made into a palazzo design.</p><h3>Men's trousers</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/720/19cb6257fe21fb4c.jpeg><p class=align-left>Years ago, the different tribes and communities in Nigeria had ceremonial clothes that often involved some sort of trousers for the men. While most of those have been overtaken by modern-day fashion, a few still exist.</p><p class=align-left>Today, Nigerian men wear trousers made from materials such as Ankara, denim, cotton, and polyester. Ankara is undoubtedly the most noticeable of all these. The bold patterns, florals, or lines are often fashioned into full length or three-quarter length trousers and then paired with plain or printed shirts and t-shirts for the ultimate Nigerian look.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/30bb1181efb69626.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Celebrity fashionista: 8 beautiful times Laura Ikeji proved to be a stylish mum</span></p></a><h3>Women's blazers</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/720/11eb17e880f04535.jpeg><p class=align-left>Nigerian women's blazers show just how much the country's native fashion has borrowed from the western <a href=#>world</a>.

It is no surprise that these clothing items have become ultra-popular in most <a href=#>African celebrities' wardrobes</a>. These blazers are often full of colours and come in a wide range of designs. One can rock their blazer with a skirt, pair of jeans, shorts, pencil skirts or short skirts.</p><h3>Men's coats</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/30bb1181efb69626.jpeg><p class=align-left>In formal settings, Nigerians often wear the conventional coats and jackets found in many other countries across the globe.
