But what exactly does FBOY Island mean?</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">'FBOY Island' stars several bachelors and only three bachelorettes. But what happens on the island?</h2><p>Subverting the stylistic standards of reality TV shows with a more traditional feel — take, for instance, <a href=#>Temptation Island</a> — FBOY Island celebrates the arduous efforts of three women ready to hone in on their active listening skills and produce a conclusive report on the moral standing of the flocks of men in their surrounds. Through a series of challenges and investigative outings, the women try to decipher which men are certified FBOYs and which are nice.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: HBO Max</a></figure><p>Urban Dictionary defines an FBOY, more commonly known by the full term of "f--k boy," as a "player," "a kid who just wants to get a girl and uses them," and "a guy who [is bound to] play with your feelings and lead you on."</p><p>F--kboys are also traditionally known for openly portraying toxic alpha male stereotypes as misguided personality traits.</p><p>FBOY Island pits several nice guys against several men who would openly describe themselves as FBoys. All the while, the three women must try to eliminate as many FBoys as possible as they search for true love.</p><p>If the women end up with nice guys at the end of the season, they win $100,000 to share with their new boos. If they wind up with FBoys, the FBoy has the final say on whether they split the cash with the women or keep it for themselves. The end of each episode features eliminations, and only then do the men reveal whether they were nice or completely effed.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">'FBOY Island' proves that FBOYs can act decent sometimes.</h2><p>Of course, even being a nice guy on TV doesn't always translate to a happily-ever-after. During Season 1, comedian and contestant <a href=#>Celisa Franco</a> ended up going after <a href=#>Jarred Evans</a>, an entrepreneur, model, and actor who joined FBOY Island in Season 1, Episode 3. A self-proclaimed nice guy, Jarred agreed to split the $100,000 price with Celisa. They broke up after the filming wrapped — proving that sometimes relationships with nice(ish) guys can turn sour, too.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by FBOY ISLAND (@fboyisland)</a></p></figure><p>On a similar note, the women may ultimately decide that they haven't found love on the island throughout the entire season. In the <a href=#>Season 2 finale</a>, bachelorette Tamarais Sepulveda shocked contestants and audiences alike when she decided to reject the remaining nice guys and keep the entire $100,000 prize for herself.</p><p>Reality show couples breaking up is nothing new, but FBoy Island is one of few shows that has the potential for its contestants to end up single when all's said and done.</p><p>Now that the show has been revived on The CW, there are even more opportunities for deceit and drama as a whole new army of potential FBoys try to woo three new women in a high-stakes dating game.</p><p>Catch new episodes of FBoy Island on The CW every Monday at 8 p.m. EST.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIydpp6rXZuvsMWMoqqlmZ6Zeq6xwKc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./309606-wasafi-star-mbosso-clears-hospital-bill-for-die-hard-mombasa-fan-html.html><span>←</span><span>Wasafi star Mbosso clears hospital bill for die-hard Mombasa fan</span></a>
