His appointment as the then NPA board chairman earned Jonathan some critics from political big wigs in the country, including some elder statesmen.</p><p>In a statement obtained by newsmen at the time, the Conference of Nigerian Political Parties (CNPP) said Jonathan insulted Nigerians by appointing Chief Anenih NPA board chairman.</p><p>The coalition sternly condemned the appointment of the indicted chieftain of the then ruling Peoples Democratic Party <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>(PDP)</strong></a> as chairman of the board of the NPA.</p><p>CNPP in <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow"><strong>the statement</strong> </a>signed and released by its then spokesperson, Osita Okechukwu, said Anenih’s appointment was “an insult to Nigerians and endorsement of corruption.”</p><p>The statement reads further: “Whereas, President Goodluck Jonathan, GCFR, has the powers by the virtue of the powers conferred on him by the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria to delegate or appointment anybody to office; however we view the appointment of Chief Anthony Anenih to chair the Board of Directors of the Nigeria Ports Authority {NPA} as an insult to Nigerians and utter endorsement of corruption.”</p><p>CNPP further argued that the Ports Authority had been infested in “endemic corruption,” since the days of two PDP leaders- Bamanga Tukur and Bode George- as its head.</p><p>“Recently the House of Representatives accused the NPA of diverting N160 billion of revenue supposed to be remitted to the Federation Account, in accordance with Section 162 of the Constitution,” the CNPP said.</p><p>“For the endemic corruption in NPA, we are alarmed that President Jonathan instead of nominating a credible, transparent and maritime professional to clean the Augean Stable in the rotten Nigeria Port Authority; has wittingly insulted the intelligence of Nigerians by appointing Chief Anenih whose notoriety in public office is legendary,” Okechukwu said.</p><p>The Conference said Mr Anenih failed woefully as Minister of Works.</p><p><strong>Naija News</strong> recalls that Chief <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Anenih later died</strong></a> on 28 October 2018.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH15e5BvZp%2Bkkai1o63CpGSmp52au7V5wKmarGWknru2rtRmmqimlJq6r7HDZqalnF2isq95zpyarqipnruoecKroK2hk5a5brzOrKCtoZ%2BjwG61zWalop%2BVp7aiedWim56nXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./dollar-to-naira-exchange-rate-today-30-november-2021.html><span>←</span><span>Dollar To Naira Exchange Rate Today 30 November 2021</span></a>
