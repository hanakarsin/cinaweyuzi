I am so ashamed, embarrassed and scandalised by the disgraceful conduct of our APC in the Edo State Primary, where four Candidates have now emerged.</p><p>“We are Progressives, for heaven’s sake! This is what happens when a few unwholesome men hijack a political party and dictate who should run, taking that role from the people.</p><p>“Why is APC bent on keeping the South South a PDP territory? Each time we have an opportunity to field a winning candidate, PDP agents in APC ensure that APC fields an inferior candidate who does not stand a chance of winning the PDP candidate. It happened in Delta, Bayelsa, Rivers and Akwa Ibom.</p><p>“OfficialAPCNg must recover our party from traders and work with core progressives in the region to give Nigerians in general and South South in particular, a decent alternative to the messed up PDP.</p><p>“At the moment, I look at the two political parties and APC is looking more like PDP than a Progressive political party.</p><p>“In conclusion, I believe that the current situation where women are excluded from leadership in APC, does the party no good. A situation where the National woman leader and state woman leaders are nominated by men, ensures that women are not adequately represented in the party. You can’t clap with one hand.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpkZH1ze5ByZqKlXZq6o63Rq5isq5WZerW0yKxkoqtdlnqltdKgqZqblWK8r7vCoaCeZaKarqTA0marqGWVmbxus9SbnKtloKe2rq3RsmY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./i-have-a-girlfriend-for-the-first-time-in-my-life-james-brown-makes-candid-revelation-on-relationship-status.html><span>←</span><span>I Have A Girlfriend For The First Time In My Life James Brown Makes Candid Revelation On Relatio</span></a>
