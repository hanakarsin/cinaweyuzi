The panel discovered that there was communication between Kyari and Hushpuppi, as well as infractions on the part of the cop, which is against the procedure of engagement of the police,” a security source told Daily Trust on Sunday.</p><p>The source revealed that the panel could not establish if Kyari committeed any crime in the US.</p><p>“There is no proof that he committed any crime on the soil of the US to warrant his extradition. He will be sanctioned by the appropriate authorities here. However, it is for the AGF to advise if there is a ground to extradite him to the US, which is very unlikely,” he added.</p><p>Reacting, the media aide to the AGF and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami (SAN), Dr Umar Gwandu, said the position of the AGF would be made known at the appropriate time.</p><p>“In line with the provision of the constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and that of the extant laws, the AGF will do the needful,” he said.</p><p>However, a senior police officer said it was only the PSC that could sanction Kyari as stipulated by law.</p><p>The police officer said the sanction could be suspension, reduction in rank or dismissal.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH16e5ByZqGto529trzPomSan5ZiuqK4wKagZpufo8CqsMSrqmadqKm%2ForDIraCopl2WwG61xqlkqq2Vp7amv4yamZuZXaDGor7IaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./393313-kangundo-watahiniwa-80-wa-kcse-wasema-wamechoka-kusoma-watoweka-shuleni-html.html><span>←</span><span>Kangundo: Watahiniwa 80 wa KCSE wasema wamechoka kusoma, watoweka shuleni</span></a>
