Greatness is in Elrond’s veins, but he has not yet totally found his place in the world.

Elros chose a mortal life, following the star of Eärendil to Númenor. Elrond, however, stayed with the elves in the realm of Lindon with Gil-galad (played in The Rings of Power by Benjamin Walker), and eventually grew to become the legendary leader whom Frodo and the rest of the Fellowship of the Ring encounter in J.R.R. Tolkien’s <a href=#>famous Lord of the Rings trilogy</a>.</p><p style=text-align:start>“The face of Elrond was ageless, neither old nor young, though in it was written the memory of many things both glad and sorrowful,” Tolkien wrote in The Fellowship of the Ring. “His hair was dark as the shadows of twilight, and upon it was set a circlet of silver; his eyes were grey as a clear evening, and in them was a light like the light of stars. Venerable he seemed as a king crowned with many winters, and yet hale as a tried warrior in the fulness of his strength.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnsBuscurpqecXZ2urbKMnqOf</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./influencer-36-t-shirts.html><span>←</span><span>Instagram Influencer with 2 Million Followers Couldn't Sell 36 T-Shirts and Twitter's Got Thoughts</span></a>
