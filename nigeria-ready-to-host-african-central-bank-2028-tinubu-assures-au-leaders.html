However, some of the pitfalls, including coup-birthed autocracies and the deleterious tinkering with constitutional tenure provisions, are developmental cancers we as Africans are giving to ourselves.”</p><p>Tinubu pointed out the military coups in the Republics of Guinea, Burkina Faso, Mali, and Niger, as well as the withdrawal of three of these nations from ECOWAS, stressing that disagreements regarding unconstitutional changes of government should not lead to a permanent breakdown of regional solidarity and collaboration.</p><p>“The drive for a peaceful, strong, and united West Africa is bigger than any one person or group of people. The bonds of history, culture, commerce, geography, and brotherhood hold deep meaning for our people. Thus, out of the dust and fog of misunderstanding and acrimony, we must seize the chance to create a new people-centric era of trust and accord.</p><p>“To all who care to listen, I declare that if you come to the table to discuss important matters in good faith, you will find Nigeria and ECOWAS already sitting there waiting to greet you as the brother that you are,” he added.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpkZH1ze5BwZqehl5q%2Fqq2Mq5yanKliwbB5x6iqrWWRm7%2Bqr8CnZJydnqm%2ForiMm5ino11nfXOEjK2gp62Sqnqiv9KuqZ6rXZbCbrjEmpueqqNk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./niece-waidhofer-html.html><span>←</span><span>Niece Waidhofer - Age, Family, Bio</span></a>
