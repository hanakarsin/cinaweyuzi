Within those 10 years of just losing myself I ended up just f---ing overdosing. Nobody knew," the former world champion said.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span></figure><p>He continued, "Doctor’s hid it, and it’s like I have f---ing minions that just hide everything, right? If Oscar does something? Hide it. I’d be out in the street at five in the morning, just walking like a zombie, almost getting ran over on the freeways — s*--t like that. Pretty bad, pretty bad."</p><p>While Oscar didn't specify exactly what kind of drugs he OD'd on, he has spoken in the past about his affinity for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">cocaine</a>, a drug he'd often imbibe.</p><p>The champion also revealed in the lead-up to the fight that when he was attending a boxing tournament in Hawaii he was "raped" by an "older woman."</p><p>He spoke about the incident with the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Los Angeles Times</a>: "I was raped at 13, from a woman, an older woman. Thirteen, lost my virginity over being, you know, being raped, basically. ... She was over 35."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span><p>Oscar De La Hoya boxing Felix Trinidad in 1999.</p></figure><p>Oscar also said that even in his "return" fight against Manny Pacquiao, he was still regularly drinking and partaking in drug use, and his decision to step back in the ring against Vitor Belfort was a chance to "find closure" for himself.</p><p>That battle will need to be put to the side, unfortunately after he was diagnosed with COVID-19.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Oscar plans to return to the boxing ring before the end of the year, despite Covid.</h2><p>The star posted an emotional video on social media discussing the unfortunate turn of events: "I mean, what are the chances of me getting Covid? I've been taking care of myself, and this really, really kicked my a--."</p><p>Despite the roadblock, Oscar stated that he is "confident" he will fight before the year is out.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I am currently in the hospital getting treatment and am confident I will be back in the ring before the year is up.
