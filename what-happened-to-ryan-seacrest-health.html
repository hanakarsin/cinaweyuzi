Like so many other shows that are finally starting back up, Live looks a little bit different these days.

However, Ryan recently had to take a couple of days off of production due to some <a href=#><u>health issues</u></a>. What happened?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">What happened to Ryan Seacrest? Health issues kept him from filming ‘Live.’</h2><p>On Thursday, Sep. 17, Live with Kelly and Ryan looked even more different than it has throughout its first couple weeks of production. That’s because Ryan was not on the show and Kelly had to host it all by herself. In the past, when Ryan or Kelly had to miss a taping of the show, there has been someone to fill in for them as a substitute — not so in these times where productions are taking extra precautions to stay safe.</p><p>On the show’s official Instagram page, the caption of a video showing Kelly’s solo entrance onto the stage shared a little bit of information about Ryan’s absence. “Ryan is home with a sore throat,” the caption reads. “We’re all being very cautious these days.” Nonetheless, Kelly walked confidently onto the set and took her seat in the lone chair behind the desk. After nearly 20 years behind the Live desk, Kelly is pretty unshakeable.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>Ryan is home with a sore throat.

We hope he’s feeling better soon and can’t wait to see him back on the show, but here’s hoping he gets a chance to actually relax for a bit! He certainly deserves a break.</p><p><strong>The best way to prevent contracting or spreading the coronavirus is with thorough hand washing and social distancing.
