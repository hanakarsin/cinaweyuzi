Who will feed these families?" he posed.<p class=align-left>Already, 27 companies have been blacklisted and their paybill numbers blocked following government's directive.</p><p class=align-left>Among those affected include Sportpesa, Betin, Betway, Betpawa, Elitebet and PremierBet among many others.</p><p class=align-left>According to BCLB boss Liti Wambua, the affected companies allegedly failed to prove they were tax compliant.</p><p class=align-left><strong>Do you have an inspirational story you would like us to publish?
