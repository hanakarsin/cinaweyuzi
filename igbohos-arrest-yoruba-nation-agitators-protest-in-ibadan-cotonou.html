He asked Fulani herders killing and raping our people to leave; is that an offence? The federal government under Buhari knows where bandits and Boko Haram leaders are but they ignore them, preferring to use Nigeria resources to kidnap peace loving people and put them in jail.</p><p>“This government watched a northern cleric romancing bandits, visiting them in the forest but this government still claims not to know bandits whereabouts.</p><p>“We call on our south-west governors and Yoruba monarchs to rise up and fight for the people that put them in position. It is not a crime if someone is asking for an end to oppression. The federal government is pushing too far in the way it is handling the issues of Igboho and Nnamdi Kanu.”</p><p>In a related development, some Yoruba people residing in Cotonou, Republic of Benin, protested at the nation’s court where it is believed that an extradition hearing of Igboho will be held.</p><p>In a video shared by Igboho’s media aide, Olayomi Koiki, the protesters were seen singing solidarity song and demanding freedom for Igboho.</p><p>The protesters noted that they have confidence in the Benin Republic justice system, expressing optimism that Igboho will be freed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH14e5FqZqKfkqS1sL%2BMmqmrnaOperq70a6ZmmWelsGqu81mmKChpJbBsL7SZqerp6SawLV5yKdkopqRma6vecKoq6imn6p8</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./davido.html><span>←</span><span>Read All The Latest News About Davido On Naija News</span></a>
