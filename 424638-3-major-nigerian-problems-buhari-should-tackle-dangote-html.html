But the point must be made that it is not peculiarly a Nigerian problem. All over the world, there are growing issues of unemployment. And what we are saying is that the in-coming government can achieve a remarkable success in this regard if it declares an emergency on unemployment and tackle it decisively. You know the organised private sector will or should play a key role in this. And that is why we are concerned</i>.”</p><p>He further lamented the extent of damage corruption has done to Nigerian economy, describing it as a “<i>big cankerworm that has really eaten deep into the fabric of our nation</i>.”</p><p>“<i>The malaise of corruption is a threat to the survival of the Nigeria economy, no doubt. We must all therefore rise in unison to tackle the menace both in the public and private sector of the economy. The Buhari-led government can show a lot of strength on this issue by showing direction, by demonstrating commitment to ridding every sector of the economy of this malaise.</i></p><p><strong>READ ALSO</strong>: <a href=#>Abdulsalami, Dangote, Others Pictured With Buhari</a></p><p><i>"I can tell you that a lot will change in Nigeria if this issue is tackled decisively</i>,” Dangote said.</p><p>The businessman called on Buhari’s administration to revisit the ongoing privatisation programme in the energy sector with a view to growing the energy capacity of the country.</p><p>According to him, if there is increased electricity output, there would be industrial growth and even the small and medium scale businesses which are dying because of insufficient energy supply, would begin to experience boom again.</p><p>Dangote is a Nigerian billionaire businessmanwho owns the Dangote Group, which has interests in commodities.
