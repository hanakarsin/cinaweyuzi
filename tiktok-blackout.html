Creative asked followers, ‚ÄúIf you haven‚Äôt heard, Dec. 8 is the TikTok blackout for Black creators. Too many Black artist / creators are silenced & shadow-banned on that platform. Tell me how many Black creators you know that go unrecognized & unacknowledged? Will you stand with us?‚Äù</p><p>With that announcement, K. Creative (@KCreative_) also pointed followers to the page of TikTok user <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Chelsea R‚ÄôKyrah Ortiz</a> (@ChelseaRkyra), who explained the reason behind the call for the blackout.&nbsp;</p><p>In her video, Chelsea explained that she posted a video to her TikTok account of herself in a bikini, in an attempt to mock a trend of skinny girls trying to hijack a movement of body positivity meant for heavier girls.</p><p>Chelsea claims that her video was immediately removed by the platform for nudity, even though all the other girls she‚Äôs seen posting about the trend have also been in similarly cut swimsuits. That is, ‚Äúevery girl except for the Black girls.‚Äù&nbsp;</p><p>Chelsea goes on to explain she quickly realized that Black girls trying to participate in this body positivity trend were getting flagged for nudity, but when she posted yet another video explaining this, it was also flagged and removed for ‚Äî you guessed it ‚Äî nudity.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@chelsearkyra href=#>@chelsearkyra</a><p><a title=duet href=#>#duet</a> with @marycjskinner tik tok y‚Äôall not slick <a title=tiktokhatesblackppl href=#>#tiktokhatesblackppl</a> <a title=tiktokisracist href=#>#tiktokisracist</a> <a title=womensupportingwomen href=#>#womensupportingwomen</a></p><a title="‚ô¨ bodies that look like this also look like this - skinner üåô" href=#>‚ô¨ bodies that look like this also look like this - skinner üåô</a></figure><p>After posting multiple videos about these injustices and being repeatedly silenced by the app for other dubious reasons like hate speech, Chelsea decided enough was enough. She decided to make another video asking creators with larger platforms than her to stand with her during a day of silence from Black creators.</p><p>In a similar story, creator George Lee Jr. boosted the post of another smaller Black creator Itohan Abigail Akharoh (@baiakharoh), whose post calling out racial insensitivity was taken down. In her TikTok video, the young Black woman explains how she came across a video of two white women lip-synching to a song with the n-word. However, when she reported it to TikTok, the post was deemed inoffensive and allowed to stay up.</p><p>But when Itohan posted another reaction video of herself in response to the original post, her video was removed for hate speech even though she didn‚Äôt say one word in it, making it pretty obvious who was spewing the hate.</p><p>In response to Chelsea and Itohan's videos, a lot of Black content creators and curators are boycotting the app on Dec. 8, 2020, and asking others to stand with them.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: twitter</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">What is the Jewish TikTok blackout about?</h2><p>Meanwhile, Dec. 10 is currently scheduled to be Jewish Creators Day for Jewish TikTok users. But there‚Äôs a bit of confusion about that.</p><p>Apparently, it all started when some ‚Äúgoyim," or a non-Jew, announced that there would be a Jewish blackout on Nov. 9 to commemorate the anniversary of Kristallnacht, which was a program carried out against Jewish people in Nazi Germany in 1938.</p><p>However, many Jewish users thought the date was inappropriate and decided to move the blackout to Dec. 10, the first day of Hanukkah. Unfortunately, according to Jewish social media users, rampant anti-Semitism on TikTok has now led to Dec. 10 being co-opted as ‚ÄúIgnore Celebrities Day‚Äù after one user calling for it received five million views.</p><p>Jewish creators are still calling for users to boost Jewish content and boycott the app on Dec. 10, but, unfortunately, with the call to "ignore celebrities" on that day instead, some messaging has been lost. Perhaps, we could all just ignore celebrities any other day.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqbaswM6kZJukkZi4sMHT</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./savannah-palacio-html.html><span>‚Üê</span><span>Savannah Palacio - Age, Family, Bio</span></a>
