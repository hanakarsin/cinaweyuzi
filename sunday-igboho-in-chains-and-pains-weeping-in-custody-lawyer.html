There was a fracas at the airport yesterday when he was arrested. They hit him in the hand and that same hand was handcuffed, he is in pains and he was weeping like a child when I called, I heard him.</p><p>“The wife too was put in a separate cell but they didn’t chain the wife. He was crying, the wife was crying too cease he was writhing in pains seriously. We only pray they don’t pay anybody to kill him. You don’t out somebody in cell and still chain the person.</p><p>“You know he sustained injury and they didn’t take him to hospital for treatment. We heard that he is appearing in court tomorrow but I don’t know whether that will carry it out.”</p><p>Alliyu argued that “The Extradition Treaty of 1984 between Togo, Nigeria, Ghana and Republic of Benin excluded political fugitives. It also states that where the fugitive will not get justice because of discrimination and/or undue delay in prosecution the host country should not release the fugitive.</p><p>“Now, Article 20 of African Charter on Human and Peoples Rights to which the four countries are signatories made agitation for self-determination a fundamental right to be protected by all countries. This made Chief Sunday Adeyemo a political offender who cannot be deported and/or extradited by the good people of the Republic of Benin for any reason.”</p><p>He urged Germany, Benin Republic and the international community “to rise up and curb the impunity of the Nigerian Government by refusing any application for extradition of our Client who already has application before the International Criminal Court duly acknowledged”.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH14e5FqZqytnpmuunnIoJmooJ9itq95wqGYoqajYq6vsIypmKKmo2LEprHPoqWgZZmjeqTB0q2mnbFdoa64xcSrZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./415431-mt-kenya-cracks-widen-meru-leaders-rally-behind-governor-kiraitu-succeed-uhuru-html.html><span>←</span><span>Mt Kenya: Cracks Widen as Meru Leaders Rally Behind Governor Kiraitu to Succeed Uhuru</span></a>
