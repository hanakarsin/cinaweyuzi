He crashed into a utility pole. He had just gotten out of baseball practice, and a few of his teammates were right behind him when the accident happened. They called 911 immediately and an ambulance took him to the hospital, where his girlfriend and those closest to them also went once they heard what happened.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">After realizing that he could've lost his life without his girlfriend knowing just how much he loved her, Kimble decided to scrap any plans of rescheduling the proposal and got down on one knee, hospital gown and all.</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>well this night didn't go as expected but it's one heck of a proposal story 😫😻💍 <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/URMJS28svU</a></p>— Sidney king (@sidneyking07) <a href=#>March 2, 2017</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">The story made many cognizant of our ephemeral presence on this Earth.</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA">Posted by <a href=#>Kayla King</a> on&nbsp;<a href=#>Thursday, March 2, 2017</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Everyone was moved by their story.</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I hear myself bawling in the background.
