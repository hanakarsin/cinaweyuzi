Don't believe me? Here he is posing with his handiwork. He's so proud of his work, and who can blame him?! He absolutely nailed it, and we love how much he loves not only the art, but also the sense of accomplishment that comes with a job well done. We are pretty inspired by you, TC.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>One of my favorite things about the <a href=#>@adage</a> Creativity 50 issue?
