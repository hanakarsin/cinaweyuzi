This means that Leicester won’t have to worry about the salary of the Nigerian forward throughout the 2023-2024 season if all parties involved agree to the deal.</p><p>Beşiktaş are particularly interested in Iheanacho because Cenk Tosun’s injury has increased the demand for a new striker at the club.</p><p>While he failed to help Leicester City remain in the Premier League in the just concluded season, Iheanacho made a significant contribution to Super Eagles of Nigeria’s qualification for the 2023 AFCON which will commence in Ivory Coast from January 2024.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>He scored the winning goal against Sierra Leone in Liberia on June 18, 2023</a>, to secure Nigeria’s participation in the forthcoming competition.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpjZH13e5FvZpudo564ta3SZqqump2ewW67xZ%2Bcq2WWpL9ut8SlnJygmWK2qbHAp5icoJ9k</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./lego-skywalker-saga-galactic-edition.html><span>←</span><span>When's The Release Date for LEGO Skywalker Saga: Galactic Edition?</span></a>
