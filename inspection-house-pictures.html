He was therefore told to take two photos in each room to make sure the house was still standing and in good shape. He wrote in a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">now-viral Facebook post</a>, "I knew this was probably a once in a lifetime opportunity." An opportunity to do what? Well, to take the silliest pictures he could. These they are.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP"></h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Facebook</a></figure><p>The bedroom looks great, the carpet is in good shape, and the walls are nice and white. You do have to keep an eye out for the monster under the bed, however. It comes with the house, unfortunately.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP"></h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Facebook</a></figure><p>The monster under the bed will eat your dad, too, so it's best to keep dads out of that room at all times, especially ones who are prone to tripping and falling near beds. The monster will grab ahold of whatever it can get its hands on.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP"></h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Facebook</a></figure><p>The bathroom looks nice and clean but nothing looks better than that man right there. Does he come with the house? Because he should. Also, I want that shower cap.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP"></h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Facebook</a></figure><p>It's important to see that the bathtub works! And my, does it ever! That bubble bath looks ideal (for a fairly short person). And in case you're wondering, yes, Tim really did send these pictures to the real estate company. (He also sent some "genuine photos" that didn't involve him in a bathtub, but those weren't as fun.)</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP"></h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Facebook</a></figure><p>OK I take it back; this is terrifying. It no longer looks ideal. This looks like a scene from season one of True Detective. The Yellow King does self-care. Is this reference timely enough for you?</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP"></h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Facebook</a></figure><p>Wow, what a lovely office! It could be a separate bedroom or a kid's playroom, or the place where you go to destroy your hand. But look at that window! The natural light is amazing!</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP"></h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Facebook</a></figure><p>I don't quite know what is happening in this photo, but it's becoming increasingly clear that while the hallway looks totally fine and normal, something has happened to Tim and his family in quarantine, and they are losing their minds a little bit. It's OK, though, because they're not alone.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP"></h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Facebook</a></figure><p>This living room is so nice and cozy! It's the perfect place to lie on the couch, grab your butt (?????), and stare at a blank TV screen for hours on end.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP"></h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Facebook</a></figure><p>Not even the man bent over with his head in the refrigerator can distract me from the strange shape of this kitchen. Is that a closet on the left or a door to another room? Why the diagonal counter where the sink is with the ends that jut out? Of everything in every photo so far, that's the most bizarre.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP"></h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Facebook</a></figure><p>This area could be a great dining table, but it also works great for some fun family torture time. The Harry Potter t-shirt really sends this one over the top.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP"></h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Facebook</a></figure><p>This photo works on several levels because you can see that the living room is in perfect shape and you can also learn the ideal activity for living room (massaging your partner's feet).&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP"></h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Facebook</a></figure><p>They could have taken a picture of the rest of the bathroom, but I don't think anyone wants to see that. I have questions about whether or not Tim knows how to use the toilet, though. His pants are up, and that, um, doesn't seem ideal.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP"></h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Facebook</a></figure><p>A whole room just for laundry?! Now that's the dream. Does it come with the man who does everyone's laundry? Because that's what I need. Laundry is the worst chore by far.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP"></h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Facebook</a></figure><p>I love how many windows this house has! They let you see everything outside, like a dude being run over by a lawn mower! You can't beat that view!</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP"></h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Facebook</a></figure><p>I don't know about you, but I'm loving that yard. It looks big and perfect for activities (like running over your dad with a lawn mower). If these pictures don't make you love not only this house but the people living in it, I don't know what to tell you.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnru0vMScq6KnnmK1sMHSnmSpoZOpwrOx0g%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./bill-gates-and-jeffrey-epstein.html><span>←</span><span>Did Bill Gates' Relationship With Jeffrey Epstein Cause His Divorce?</span></a>
