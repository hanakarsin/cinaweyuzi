It was a decision I made to get a few things for myself and to get closer to God because so many things happened to me in Nigeria that I was not happy about.</p><p><strong>Does that mean you wouldn't have been closer to God if you were in Nigeria</strong>?</p><p>I would always have time for anybody and appreciate the presence of a man or woman of substance.</p><p><strong>What do you do here presently</strong>?</p><p>Apart from filmmaking, I am into the development of grassroots’ talents in music and filmmaking.</p><p><strong>How is that going</strong>?</p><p>It has been very great.</p><p><strong>Are Ghanaians embracing you</strong>?</p><p>You know, love thy neighbour like thyself is my tool across the Nile unto Jericho. I think everybody loves me. I don’t know who the enemy is. So, whoever the enemy is, I am sorry, I forgive all haters. That is what it is.</p><p><strong>Should your fans in Nigeria be expecting something from you soon</strong>?</p><p>Well, everything depends on God. He is my provider. If God wants me to go to Nigeria, no problem, I mean, as long as you are serious with the job.</p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkg3SBj3JloaydoQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./corona-song-tiktok.html><span>←</span><span>TikTok Users Are Using the Corona Song to Help You Prevent Coronavirus</span></a>
