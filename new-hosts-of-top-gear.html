Since his retirement, the athlete went on to have a career in sports broadcasting, appearing on the award-winning sports panel show, A League Of Their Own.&nbsp;</p><p>Delving into entertainment, Freddie was a contestant on the reality show I’m a Celebrity Get Me Out of Here. &nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span></figure><p>The popular reality show features contestants competing in a Survivor-esque competition.

It’s not particularly pleasant but I don’t feel the urge to drink and I don’t feel the urge to do something to try to change my state of mind. I’m actually quite comfortable with it.”&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Who is Freddie’s wife?</h2><p>Freddie married former model and business entrepreneur Rachael Wools in 2005. As a teenager, Rachael started her own events company called Strawberry Promotions.

In a 2018 interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>John Bishop</u></a>, the TV presenter broke down while discussing that his twins had been diagnosed with autism. &nbsp;</p><p>"It’s very, very, very, very difficult, you know any parent with children with any kind of special needs is very difficult,” the 45-year-old said. Adding, “Some days it’s a wonder how we’re still together, me and Christine, because you can’t sort of do the normal things that you would as a couple.”</p><p>Catch new episodes of Top Gear on Sundays at 8 p.m. on BBC America. &nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfo7K4eceoqq2rXaSzbsDOqWSgnZGn</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./nikhil-keswani-html.html><span>←</span><span>BigNik - Age, Family, Bio</span></a>
