That is 29 years ago and the same man is still in the race? Haba naa.</p><p>“President Buhari was contesting the election under his own party like the ANPP, CPC and later APC. You cannot compare those political parties with the PDP, which is a national party.</p><p>“If Atiku was a candidate in 2019 and we lost the election, it is only equitable to allow another candidate from the South to try this time around.</p><p>“We cannot continue to recycle leaders who should be resting at home with their grandchildren to come to lead us in this 21st century. We need upwardly mobile young Nigerians to take the shot and create a new paradigm shift in terms of our leadership orientation.</p><p>“It is time for us to say capital NO to Methuselah politics. We are tired of these tired legs. We need to breathe.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH1ze49uZpqsmaDCbr%2FHqKylnF2Xsm7AyKucnWWfm3qmxcinnmaooprAqrDEp5qyZZakv25%2Bk2awnpmiqHqissSgma6ZXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tony-robbins-html.html><span>←</span><span>Tony Robbins - Age, Family, Bio</span></a>
