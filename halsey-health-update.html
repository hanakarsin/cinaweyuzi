Short story long, I wrote an album,” Halsey wrote in the Instagram caption.</p><p>Her post was timed with the release of “The End,” an acoustic single on her upcoming album. Although <a href=#>Halsey</a> didn’t explicitly share what she was diagnosed with at the time, she did hint at it.</p><p>She did so by tagging the Instagram accounts of Lupus Research Alliance and the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society.</p><p>The singer has opened up about her health struggles since then.

You’ve all been so kind so I want to share a bit more.”</p><p>She continued by sharing her two diagnoses: “In 2022, I was first diagnosed with Lupus SLE and then a rare T-cell lymphoproliferative disorder. Both of which are currently being managed or in remission; and both of which I will likely have for the duration of my life.”</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lupus SLE (systematic lupus erythematosus)</a> is the most common form of the autoimmune disease. It’s caused by the immune system mistaking attacking healthy tissue.</p><p>Symptoms include fatigue, fever, and hair loss.</p><p>Several celebrities struggle with lupus, such as <a href=#>Selena Gomez</a>, Lady Gaga, and Nick Cannon.</p><p>T-cell lymphoproliferative disorder is lesser known. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Health</a>, it’s a term used to describe diseases that result in an overproduction of lymphocytes.</p><p>“After a rocky start, I slowly got everything under control with the help of [my] amazing doctor,” Halsey continued in her Instagram post.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by halsey (@iamhalsey)</a></p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram | @iamhalsey</a></figure><p>“After two years, I’m feeling better and I’m more grateful than ever to have music to turn to.

At the end of June, she attended the premiere — her first red carpet event since revealing her health battle — of her new film, MaXXXine.
