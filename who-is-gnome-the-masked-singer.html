After all, not too much information about the Gnome has been released, other than its mask and costume. As a result, the guesses are all over the place.</p><p>So, who is the Gnome on The Masked Singer?

Here’s everything that we've learned:</p><ul><li>The Gnome’s costume appears to be made out of flowers and grass, which can lead to their identity being related to nature.</li><li>Leprechauns are considered to be Gnomes that are magical creatures in Ireland.</li></ul><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Gnome on The Masked Singer — The Guesses</h2><p>As we mentioned above, the clues are extremely limited when it comes to the Gnome. However, the little that we have to work with has caused some people to believe that <a href=#>One Direction member Niall Horan</a> may be the masked singer. After all, Niall is Irish, and since he’s a singer it gives him an edge in the competition. On the flip side, some folks strongly believe that actors Danny Devito or Martin Short may be the celeb behind the mask.</p><p>Other early guesses for the Gnome include:</p><ul><li>Sean Austin</li><li>James McAvoy</li><li>Warwick Davis</li><li><a href=#>Elijah Wood</a></li></ul><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span><p>Niall Horan, Danny Devito, and Martin Short</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">So, who is the Gnome on ‘The Masked Singer?’ The answer is….</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: FOX</span></figure><p>Final guesses ranged from Dustin Hoffman to Robert DeNiro on The Masked Singer.
