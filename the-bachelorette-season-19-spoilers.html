Instead of one leading lady, there are two; that's right, <a href=#>Gabby Windey and Rachel Recchia</a> will serve as co-leads on <a href=#>Season 19</a>.</p><p>Although filming is currently underway, resident spoiler king <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Reality Steve</a> has the full scoop. So, without further ado, let's delve into the juiciest spoilers regarding Season 19 of The Bachelorette.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: ABC</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Here are the juiciest spoilers about 'The Bachelorette' Season 19.</h2><p>Ahead of filming the historic season, ABC offered fans an early look at <a href=#>35 potential contestants vying</a> for Gabby or Rachel's heart; however, once filming commenced, Reality Steve <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">reported</a> that Koy Schneiter and Corbin Shaw had been cut from the show. Though no reason was given for their removal, it's likely producers didn't deem them a good fit for the two co-leads.</p><p>Additionally, Reality Steve <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">announced</a> that a contestant from a previous Bachelorette season would make an appearance. In a now-deleted Instagram post, the blogger revealed that the returning contestant was <a href=#>Connor Brennan</a>.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>reality steve drops a dumbass rumor that i’m going back on bachelorette and suddenly i’m flooded with the meanest things anyone has ever said about me and a great reminder why i wouldn’t go back on the show</p>— oat (@sad_oat) <a href=#>March 26, 2022</a></figure><p>Nevertheless, this proved false once Connor <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">replied</a> to Reality Steve on Twitter, writing, "news to me lmao," with a crying-laughing emoji. Unfortunately, the report still caused Connor to face severe backlash on social media, which he declared was a "great reminder why [he] wouldn’t go back on the show."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Gabby and Rachel travel internationally with their suitors.</h2><p>There will be more international sequences this season! According to Reality Steve, via the Instagram account <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@bachelorwhatever</a>, Season 19 heads to Europe in Episode 4.</p><p>The post shared that the co-leads and their suitors will fly to U.K.'s Portsmouth and "board the Virgin Voyage cruise," which serves as their transportation and residence while across the pond; from there, the group will trek to France and dock at Le Havre.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Bachelorwhatever (@bachelorwhatever)</a></p></figure><p>Following France, the group head to Belgium for Episode 5. While in Belgium, it appears Rachel has a 1-on-1 date with Aven Jones, a 29-year-old medical sales representative. Check out the photos from their date <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>!</p><p>Then, in Episode 6, the Bachelorettes and their remaining suitors travel to Amsterdam; there, the co-leads prepare to narrow their search to just four contestants, meaning <a href=#>hometowns</a> are right around the corner.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">We know 3/4 of Gabby and Rachel's final four!</h2><p>On April 23, Reality Steve posted a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">video</a> of Rachel and Aven on a hometown date in Salem, Mass. The clip shows the pair taking a horse carriage ride to Crow Haven Corner, the oldest witch shop in Salem. Later, Reality Steve also shared <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">footage</a> of the duo outside Finz restaurant.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>(HOMETOWN SPOILER): Pics are blurry, but confirmation that Gabby is filming a hometown date in Bedminster, NJ today with Erich Schwer.
