A quick preview of his life is a testimony one can achieve anything as long as they remain committed.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>Kimwarer: Kipchumba Murkomen clashes with Tony Gachoka over dam project's cancellation</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/1120/32376aefe54d8afe_w.jpeg><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>Indigenous tree claimed to miraculously heal infections among Luhyas</p><p class=align-left>Now the Member of County (MCA) for Milima Ward in Bungoma County, Amunavi traces the genesis of his rise to a samosa hawking job in Kapsabet town.</p><p class=align-left>He remembers a grueling life he went through as a child from a peasant family that could not even afford to sustain his stay in secondary school.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>Kibra by-election: ODM rebel MP Aisha Jumwa openly campaigns for Jubilee man Mariga</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/720/158c2aae5011ad7b.jpeg><p class=align-left>Amunavi's life in school was pushed too close to the edge forcing him to drop out and start hawking samosa.</p>"While in Form Two in 2002 at Kapsabet Boys High School, my parents could not raise school fees and this compelled me to drop out out.I started by making samosas and in a month, I could make up to KSh 500 in profit. My aim was to save enough money to enable me go back to school," the lawmaker told&nbsp;Tuko.co.ke during an interview.&nbsp;<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/720/d1489403c1641186.jpeg><p class=align-left>After selling samosas for sometime, Amunavi says he decided to look for greener pastures and his quest landed him a job at a restaurant in Kapsabet Town.</p><p class=align-left>The father of three says he worked for six months and managed to save enough money that he later injected in another hawking venture that he deemed more profitable.</p>"This time round it was not samosa. I invested in watches, purses, torches, earrings, handkerchiefs and sweets among others," Amunavi explained.<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/720/062ee630c7a68c6c_w.jpeg><p class=align-left>His investment, however, did not last long since soon as profits started tricking in, thieves broke into his store and made away with all merchandise.</p>"One day I went to the shop where I used to keep my stock only to realise that my goods had been stolen. This shook me to the core. I had to start all over again," the MCA said.<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/720/dbb717d0f226b035_w.jpeg><p class=align-left>However, that was the time Amunavi believed that in every desert of calamity, God provides an oasis. A good friend offered to give him stock on credit and he pledged to offset the debt in installments.</p><p class=align-left>in 2003, Amunavi had raised some little cash and was readmitted in Form Three at Mukuyuni Secondary School.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/720/29f062cb3fe7ddd5.jpeg><p class=align-left>Before the end of first term, his dad passed on and the tragedy totally changed the direction of his dreams.</p>"After death of my dad, my aunts took me to St Peter's Mumias Boys where I sat for my KCSE and scored B+ of 72 points. This gave me a chance to be enrolled at the University of Nairobi where I took my undergraduate studies in Political Science and Swahili and later graduated with Second Class (Upper Division) in 2011," he narrated.&nbsp;<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/720/fe147a7e6d067cd1_w.jpeg><p class=align-left>The idea of leadership, Amunavi says dawned to him while he was till in campus where he served as a Hall Representative.</p>"I had never envisioned becoming a politician when I was growing up. My relatives had however, nicknamed me Professor Saitoti owing to academic excellence I had shown during my days at school.When I was a student official at UoN, I helped many students access bursaries and this cushioned them financial burdens that I had experienced before. This is when passion for becoming a leader started burning in me," he continued.<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/720/fe925a60d106809d_w.jpeg><p class=align-left>Apart from his legislative role at the Bungoma County Assembly, Amunavi is a committed farmer who has practices mixed farming.&nbsp;</p><p class=align-left>He also rares dairy cows, keeps broilers and layers in his poultry.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/720/5d035d77b6dce565_w.jpeg><p class=align-left>He clinched the Milima MCA seat following the 2017 General Election where floored 22 other candidates who were interested in the position.</p><p class=align-left>According to him, success in life only comes when one is able to utilise opportunities that come their way and also ability to identify blessings that are usually disguised as challenges.</p>"I urge young people to maximise any opportunity they came across for they know not what the future holds for them. On my part, I have higher ambitions but I will cross the bridge once I get there," he said while hinting that he has plans to vie for a bigger seat.<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/720/d567b8595a6d8024_w.jpeg><p class=align-left><strong><i>Story by by Enock Ndayala - TUKO.co.ke Correspondent</i></strong></p><p class=align-left><strong><i>Do you have a groundbreaking story you would like us to publish?
