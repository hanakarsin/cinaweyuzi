International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) loan to support Uhuru's affordable housing project which is one of the pillars of the Big Four agenda.</p>"The Kenya Affordable Housing Finance Project (KAHFP) will support the establishment and operationalization of the Kenya Mortgage Refinance Corporation (KMRC), a largely private sector-owned and non-deposit taking financial institution under the supervision of the Central Bank of Kenya," said Felipe Jaramillo, World Bank Kenya country director.<p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: Kenya's public debt rises to KSh 5

(UK), on May 15, and will be issued in two tranches.</p>"The government of Kenya, acting through the National Treasury, successfully priced a new US$2.1 billion (KSh 210 billion), dual-tranche Eurobond of seven-year and 12-year tenors on May 15, 2019, in London, United Kingdom," Rotich said in a statement to newsrooms.<p class=align-left>He explained the two Eurobond tranches were priced at 7% interest rate for a seven-year maturity period and 8% interest for a 12-year tenure.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: Kenya's public debt rises to KSh 5 trillion after government borrowed

expected to mature in June 2019, among other debt obligations.</p>"It will also be used to refinance part or all of the obligations outstanding under the U$750 million (2014 Eurobond) due on June 24, 2019, and potentially part of the other debt obligations," he said.<p class=align-left>The loans are being taken despite rising concerns over ballooning public debt which staggered at KSh 5.4 trillion
