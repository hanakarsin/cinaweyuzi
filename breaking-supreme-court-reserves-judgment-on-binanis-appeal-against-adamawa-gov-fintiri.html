Hudu Yunusa-Ari, the then-resident electoral commissioner (REC) in Adamawa State, who has since been suspended, declared Binani as the winner in the absence of the returning officer and before polls were concluded.</p><p>INEC, however, invalidated this announcement and continued with the collation of results.</p><p>The final tally showed Binani with 398,788 votes, while Fintiri emerged victorious with 430,861 votes.</p><p>Subsequent to these events, Yunusa-Ari was arrested and handed over to the police for prosecution.</p><p>Prior to reaching the Supreme Court, both the state election petition tribunal and the Court of Appeal had dismissed Binani’s petition against Fintiri’s victory.</p><p>The APC and its candidate are now seeking redress at the apex court, hoping for a favourable judgment.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpkZH1ye5FyZpuqlZa4qrrGZqquqKKauqZ5wqisq6xdp7K0sdGvnKxlmqqxqLnEp6tmp55ir6q6wKegrGWRpb2mrctmmKCZmaPAtXnAnZimmaeWeqi71Wadoqaknr%2Bqew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./do-ariana-madix-and-tom-sandoval-still-live-together.html><span>←</span><span>Moving Up and Out!
