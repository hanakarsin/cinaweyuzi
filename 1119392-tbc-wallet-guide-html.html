Today, 1 TheBillionCoin goes for more than 43 BitCoins. Its creators claim that the value of TBC grows by 3% every day, so this number might be obsolete tomorrow. The smallest change of TBC is called Kringle.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/efdb0d64566aac40.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>A simple way of registering your company using the CAC portal</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Below, you can find information on how to use your TBC client on your PC and on your Android mobile phone.</p><h2>TBC wallet guide (for PC)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/efdb0d64566aac40.jpeg><p class=align-left><strong>Step 1.</strong> Go to the TBC website (tbc004.net).

The app was removed either by its creators, or by the Play Store. All you can find now is a knock-off version of the TBC app called The Billion Coin App.</p><p class=align-left>Just by looking at the Developer line, you might notice that it says FudMart, which is already suspicious.</p><p class=align-left>But wait, there is more:</p><p class=align-left>Despite the 4.5-star rating, some users reported that the app stole their login information. We cannot confirm or deny that, by this app is definitely not the official TBC you were looking for. It only offers access to TBC websites, which are not even optimised for mobile users.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/vllkyt78j4ie7p5ms.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Detailed guide on how to play Golden Chance Lotto online</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/720/vllkyt6qt9hc0qnf3.jpeg><p class=align-left>After looking around the TheBillionCoin forum, we were able to find information that the Android TBC servers were shut down in February. It means that the app no longer works. Therefore, if you download it from third-party websites, you will not be able to use it.</p><p class=align-left>However, you can still access the TBC website from your phone browser. It is not as convenient as from the PC, but what can you do?</p><p class=align-left>One more thing:</p><p class=align-left>At the same forum post, the Admin said that the Android users of the TBC wallet would no longer be able to gain access to their funds. If they did not transfer their funds to their TBC Web Wallet in time, their funds would disappear. So if you missed your chance, we are so sorry, but there is nothing you can do now to retrieve those funds.</p><h2>Warning</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/vllkythmeeihgvgf8.jpeg><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/vllkyt1mnb4t9bevj.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>10 easy steps to changing sign in settings on Yahoo mail</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Before you go:</p><p class=align-left>There are a few things you might want to know about TBC and the TBC wallet.</p><p class=align-left>❶ Your TBC wallet can be suspended for up to 6 months without any warning. It might happen if you break the Membership Agreement in any way. Therefore, read it carefully before engaging in any questionable activities with your TBC. For example, you are prohibited from selling TBC at a discount or attempting to crack the source code.</p><p class=align-left>❷ You might experience issues with your TBC wallet. If you perform several transactions at the same time and do not wait for confirmation, your wallet might malfunction. It is recommended you wait for at least one transaction to clear, but it is better if you wait for six confirmations to avoid any problems.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/720/vllkyt1agaod2e9t5g.jpeg><p class=align-left>❸ Several websites (including yours truly) accused TBC of being a Ponzi scheme, or, in other words, a scam. It grows by attracting new members and it will eventually collapse when new people stop coming in. So participate at your own risk, you have been warned.</p><p class=align-left>That is it for our TheBillionCoin wallet guide. Now you would be able to use your TBC wallet without any problems. However, keep in mind that it might not be what you think it is.
