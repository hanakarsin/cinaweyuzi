The name of the business cannot be seen, but @zzawadii notes in the comment section that it's a gas station in Tacoma, Wash.</p><p>At this gas station, customers can also grab some late-night grub from the food truck <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Italy Paola Pizza Napoletana.</a> And it appears that the local Italian business has a scrolling LED sign hung up on the gas station's window, where they advertise menu items. But unfortunately, it looks like some of the gas station employees reprogrammed the sign to get revenge on their boss.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@zzawadii href=#>@zzawadii</a><p><a title=capcut href=#>#CapCut</a> <a title=venusretrograde href=#>#venusretrograde</a> is gettin yall BAD ooooooouuuuu 😭😭😭😭 run and hide for cover 🪑🪑🪑🪑🪑🪑🪑🪑🪑🪑🪑🪑</p><a title="♬ original sound - zZzZz" href=#>♬ original sound - zZzZz</a></figure><p>In @zzawadii,'s video, the text being projected on the sign read, "The boss likes to sleep with his employees behind his wife's back."</p><p>@zzawadii, who appears to be in a car with others while filming, can be heard screaming as each message scrolls by.</p><p>After that "Italy Paolo Pizza Napeoltana" scrolls by followed by "Open 11 a.m. to 7 p.m." Tuesday through Saturday."</p><p>Then, "Try one of their handmade cannolis!
