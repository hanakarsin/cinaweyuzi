Me and his children have lived together and shared the same bed. When I did not have anywhere to go, he took me in. He has also taken care of me to an extent. That is the true definition of family. I know him very well and I believe he means well for the youth. I also think he is the best presidential candidate.</p><p>“I was attacked after I made that tweet (about Atiku being my father), and I wondered why.”</p><p>When asked if he called Atiku his father because of pecuniary gains, he replied: “If I eventually go into politics, it will be for the benefit of my constituency. However, I don’t want to become a politician because I don’t want people to insult me. I cannot collect money from Atiku, and I have never collected money to campaign for any politician.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH14e49tZpqsmaDCbsDOqKJmpZVitq951qGcp2WZYrWisIynpmavmJq%2FpnnTqGSgp12axW6uwaeYoqKRYrWwwdKepJqslWQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./alice-krige-html.html><span>←</span><span>Alice Krige - Age, Family, Bio</span></a>
