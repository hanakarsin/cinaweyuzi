With a whopping 209.18 million subscribers worldwide, with 74 million in the US and Canada alone, the black and red brand has managed to make a lot of money since it started its early years as a DVD rental mailing business. Over the years, they've slowly began raising prices on and restructuring its plan. And in the beginning of 2022, they jacked up the cost again. So why did they raise subscription prices?</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Why did Netflix raise subscription prices?</h2><p>It's Basic Plan, which omits HD streaming and only allows 1 screen and one phone or tablet you can download movies on has been jacked up to $9.99 a month from $8.99.</p><p>The Standard Plan is getting raised from $13.99 to $15.49 and it allows HD streaming but allows 2 users to use the service simultaneously and download movies/shows on two separate tablets or smartphones.</p><p>And then there's the Premium Plan. The ultimate flex in Netflix subscription services that allows you and three other moochers who don't even know what a Netflix Agreement looks like to use 4 screens/devices simultaneously whilst viewing. You can use four smartphones or tablets to download movies and shows on and you've got access to Ultra HD 4K. Nice. That price of that's going up from $18 to $20.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Do the Netflix subscription prices affect current customers? Or are they for new ones only?</h2><p>You know what's always sucked about cable companies? For some reason they always give new customers discounts and treat ones who've been with them for a long time like pieces of garbage. They're <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">constantly trying to raise prices on existing customers</a> and giving new ones all of the added benefits/discounts when it comes to pricing.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Each time Netflix raises their price, more people cancel their subscription and then split the bill with someone else.</p><p>At some point raising prices will lead to less revenue. <a href=#>https://t.co/IxwadpT3Qf</a></p>— Sub Zero ❄️ (@SubZeroGold) <a href=#>January 14, 2022</a> <span>Source: Twitter | @SubZeroGold</span></figure><p>Netflix is doing the opposite. If you're a new customer, then you're going to have to pay the increased service cost fees right away. However, if you've been "grandfathered" into a plan, then you'll get to enjoy the current price you have until it eventually gets raised.</p><p>As to why this price hike has occurred, it probably just has to do with the fact that Netflix simply can.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Y’all keep raising prices but the quality of content is not getting better, y’all cancel good shows, renew dumb ones for multiple seasons….I’m bout done with Netflix all this stuff is easily watchable on the internet for free anyways, this is why ur stock price is going down</p>— MarkG (@HeartoftheCity_) <a href=#>January 14, 2022</a> <span>Source: Twitter | @HeartoftheCity_</span></figure><p>The company's managed to secure a huge userbase and is one of a few streamers that still don't incorporate advertisements into its programming. Plus its library of original programming and licensed shows just keeps growing every year, meaning that a Netflix subscription these days gets you access to more content than you previously had before.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>The streaming giant NETFLIX has officially announced the 2nd price hike in USA during the pandemic.</p><p>Basic plan hits $10 per month from $9, Standard plans will rise to $15.50 per month from $14, while the 4K plan will rise to $20 per month from $18.</p><p>42% price hike since 2018. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/rsOnwC0jFg</a></p>— LetsOTT GLOBAL (@LetsOTT) <a href=#>January 15, 2022</a> <span>Source: Twitter | @LetsOTT</span></figure><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Netflix is also consistently rated as the top streaming service provider in the business</a>, followed closely by Amazon Prime, but there are other major players in the game that are directly tied to legacy Hollywood studios that are quickly adding their own titles to their streaming libraries once the licensing agreements with Amazon and Netflix begin to phase out.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Netflix not even good enough to keep upping the price. They finna lose me.</p>— Larry Legend (@larryislegend) <a href=#>January 15, 2022</a> <span>Source: Twitter | @larryislegend</span></figure><p>Which is why years back Netflix and Prime were so focused on pushing its original content to make up the bevy of its programming bucket. Netflix has recently reached a milestone with its original programming: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">40% of its media is originally produced</a> by the streaming service, which includes a number of hit movies and TV shows.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLW6ecOim2amlamzrbXXZqmaoaOaerTBwayaq6GgqbawuoypqaKblag%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./paige-hyland-html.html><span>←</span><span>Paige Hyland - Age, Family, Bio</span></a>
