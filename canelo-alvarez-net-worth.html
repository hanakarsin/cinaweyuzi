While talents like <a href=#>Floyd Mayweather</a>, Evander Holyfield, Muhammad Ali, Joe Fraiser, and Mike Tyson are some that boxing fans know and love, there are other athletes who contribute to the sport in major ways. And <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Canelo √Ålvarez</a> is one that fans have great respect for.</p><p>The Mexican-born athlete has done very well for himself over the years and continues to be one of the top men in boxing. And since his name has been mentioned throughout many industries such as wine and spirits, athleisure, and sports brands, it‚Äôs safe to say that Canelo is bringing in bank.

Sure, being a champ works in your favor to access money, endorsements, and fame, but one wrong move can mean the end of your career. Hence, why not all aspiring boxers are able to make it big.</p><p>However, Canelo (real name: Saul Canelo √Ålvarez) has paid his dues and has become one of the most world-renowned boxers. As such, he is always a name that is requested for matches, and his upcoming fight with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Billy Joe Saunders</a> is definitely one to watch. Not only are both men in their prime, but they both also have great records.&nbsp;</p><p>Canelo is the super middleweight title holder who has only lost once to Floyd Mayweather.
