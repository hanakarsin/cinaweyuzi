One such candidate is <a href=#>Andy Beshear</a>, the democratic governor of Kentucky who followed in his father’s footsteps to hold the highest political office in a GOP-controlled state.</p><p>In fact, Andy was able to defeat the Trump-backed incumbent Kentucky governor in 2019, defeating another Republican opponent in 2023. Proving his competence in winning over swing state voters, Andy’s faith could be a huge reason for his popularity in otherwise red states. So what is Andy Beshear’s religion?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Religion is important to Andy Beshear, who attends church every Sunday with his family.</h2><p>While many Republicans are critical of Andy’s dedication to his religion because of his political views, he’s spoken frequently and fondly of his faith. Andy and his wife, Britainy, are members of the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ). Not only are they members, but they are both deacons at Beargrass Christian, the church they attend every Sunday with their two children, Will and Lila.</p><p>Beyond that, Andy comes from a long line of ministers. His father, Steve Beshear, who was also a democratic governor of Kentucky from 2007–2015, taught Andy about their family’s dedication to the Christian faith. Andy’s grandfather was actually a Baptist minister from Dawson Springs, Kent. His great-grandfather was also a Baptist minister. In fact, religion has been one of the driving principles behind Andy’s campaigns and his connection to his constituents.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>“Together, we will not meet hate with hate, or anger with anger, or even frustration with frustration,” Andy said in his <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">2023 inaugural speech</a>. “Instead, we will continue with the same love, empathy, and compassion that has guided us through so much. For me, these values are grounded in my faith. It teaches me to love my neighbor as myself. To not judge, lest I be judged. That what I do to the least of thee, I do to He.</p><p>“My faith teaches me that all human beings deserve true dignity and opportunity and that we can come together simply by acknowledging that our faith and values call us to be better; and for me, remembering that my savior could have been the Prince of Power, but chose to be the Prince of Peace.”</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Andy Beshear (@andybeshearky)</a></p></figure><p>Andy has shared throughout the years that he credits his religion with his democratic outlook as a way to bring people together rather than to tear them apart. He’s a great example of someone who works across the political aisle to appease (and upset) both sides, usually with his dedication to Christianity at the center of it.</p><p>In fact, Andy’s faith has even driven his views on reproductive rights, as he believes that men should not seek power over women and their bodies. He has been frequently criticized for a “pro-abortion” stance, when in reality, he simply believes that women should not be forced into pregancy against their wishes, especially in cases of sexual assault.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Andy Beshear (@andybeshearky)</a></p></figure><p>But when Andy’s opponent, Matt Bevin, criticized his views, Andy’s minister, Leigh Bond, shared, "Even with their demanding schedule, the [Beshear] family makes it a priority to be present in worship. And they don’t just ‘show up.’ Their faith and commitment to God inspire them to serve others and engage in ministry beyond the walls of the church."</p><p>Regardless of whether or not Andy is Kamala’s running mate, his dedication to his faith while likely help him bring Americans on both sides of the aisle together.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhflrulxYybnKyglZa%2Fbr7EpaCgoZ%2Bj</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./car-love-guaranteed.html><span>←</span><span>The Car in 'Love, Guaranteed' Has Become a Major Point of Conversation</span></a>
