Manchester United beat Ipswich 9-0 in 1995 and Southampton by the same score last year. Leicester also won 9-0 at Southampton in 2019.</p><p>The result was all the more remarkable given Liverpool, who just months ago came within two games of an unprecedented quadruple, had made their worst league start in a decade.</p><p>Fabinho returned to stiffen up Liverpool’s midfield in the wake of Monday’s 2-1 defeat away to Manchester United that left them five points back of reigning champions Manchester City.</p><p>Having struggled without the departed Sadio Mane in their first three games, Liverpool’s attack instantly clicked Saturday as Firmino floated in a cross for Diaz to head home inside three minutes.</p><p>The Brazilian also played his part in the second as his heavy touch rolled invitingly towards Elliott, the 19-year-old curling in from the edge of the area for his first top-flight goal.</p><p>Mohamed Salah forced Mark Travers to tip over and somehow glanced wide when Elliott fizzed a cross towards the Egyptian, but the respite was temporary for Scott Parker’s overmatched side.</p><p>After repeatedly being targeted in the United defeat, Alexander-Arnold displayed his undoubted quality with a thumping drive into the top corner from 20 metres.</p><p>Firmino then got in on the act as Salah’s attempted pass looped wickedly off a Bournemouth player and right to the Brazilian to stab in from close range.</p><p>Ryan Christie grazed the post in a rare chance for Bournemouth, who were powerless to stop the Liverpool onslaught.</p><p>Van Dijk headed in Andy Robertson’s corner on the stroke of half-time as Liverpool scored five goals in the opening half of a Premier League game for the first time.</p><p>The Reds struck again a minute into the second period as Mepham poked Alexander-Arnold’s cross into his own net.</p><p>Firmino reached 100 Liverpool goals by reacting quickest to pounce on the loose ball after Robertson swung in a dangerous delivery that Travers could only parry.</p><p>Portuguese teenager Carvalho fired in to make it eight being teed up by Kostas Tsimikas’ cushioned lay-off, notched his first goal for the club since signing from Fulham.</p><p>Diaz then headed in the record-equalling goal with six minutes to play as Liverpool shook off a slow start to the campaign in stunning fashion.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH15e5FwZqWhppq%2FsbvOpWSspZGotW6uzq6pp52dpMK1tIxyZGllmaN6s7HCqKmdZZWluW7DyKdm</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kianna-johnson-html.html><span>←</span><span>Kianna Jay - Age, Family, Bio</span></a>
