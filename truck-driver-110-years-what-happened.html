And while his actions did take four lives, he never intended any harm.</p><p>As he testified in court, the brakes on his truck failed shortly before he plowed into stopped traffic. Not to mention, he was driving down a steep route from the Rocky Mountain foothills and lost control of the vehicle.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Good morning. I’m at the Capitol covering a rally for trucker Rogel Lazaro Aguilera-Mederos, who faces a 110-year sentence after being found guilty for his involvement in a deadly crash in Lakewood in 2019.

He also had a clean driving record.</p><p>"I am not a criminal,” he said. “I am not a murderer. I am not a killer. When I look at my charges, we are talking about a murderer, which is not me. I have never thought about hurting anybody in my entire life," he said during his sentencing.</p><p>However, what prosectors did have on him was that he was traveling at least 85 mph on a part of the highway where commercial vehicles were limited to 45 mph because of the steep descent from the mountains. Police also noted that before the crash, he passed a ramp on the side that was designed to safely stop trucks and other vehicles that may have lost control of their brakes.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Nearly five million people want Aguilera-Mederos's sentence to be commuted, per Change.org.</h2><p>Following Aguilera-Mederos's sentencing, his supporters started an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">online petition</a> on Change.org to commute his sentence. It has garnered nearly five million signatures so far.</p><p>The petition argues that some of the blame should be placed on the trucking company he drove for, which has had several inspections since 2017 that pointed out mechanical violations.</p><p>In a series of tweets, TV personality <a href=#>Kim Kardashian</a>, who just passed <a href=#>the Baby Bar exam,</a> also spoke out in support of Aguilera-Mederos.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I know everyone has been posting about Rogel Aguilera-Mederos this week.

However, because of the mandatory minimums in Colorado, his hands were tied. Mandatory minimums take away judicial discretion and need to end," Kim said about the case.</p><p>While some states allow sentences to run concurrently or at the same time, Colorado instead stacks them on top of each other. His sentence may have been significantly shorter had he been charged in another state.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>On Dec. 27, a Colorado judge scheduled a new hearing on Jan. 13, 2022, to reconsider Aguilera-Mederos's sentence, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">CNN</a>.</p><p>District Attorney Alexis King told the outlet that they would "likely be recommending a sentence of between 20 and 30 years," after re-examining the facts in the case as well as hearing input from the victims and their families.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqb%2B2r8pmm6uhppq%2Fbn2QaWSynZGnwG7Dx5qrZqCRpb2musSd</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./glenda-dela-cruz-html.html><span>←</span><span>Glenda Dela Cruz - Age, Family, Bio</span></a>
